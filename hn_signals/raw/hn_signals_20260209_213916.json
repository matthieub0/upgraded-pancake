      "body_text": "I'm a software engineer who keeps getting pulled into DevOps no matter how hard I try to escape it. I recently moved into a Lead DevOps Engineer role writing tooling to automate a lot of the pain away. On my own time outside of work, I built Artifact Keeper — a self-hosted artifact registry that supports 45+ package formats. Security scanning, SSO, replication, WASM plugins — it's all in the MIT-licensed release. No enterprise tier. No feature gates. No surprise invoices.\nYour package managers — pip, npm, docker, cargo, helm, go, all of them — talk directly to it using their native protocols. Security scanning with Trivy, Grype, and OpenSCAP is built in, with a policy engine that can quarantine bad artifacts before they hit your builds. And if you need a format it doesn't support yet, there's a WASM plugin system so you can add your own without forking the backend.\nWhy I built it:\nPart of what pulled me into computers in the first place was open source. I grew up poor in New Orleans, and the only hardware I had access to in the early 2000s were some Compaq Pentium IIs my dad brought home after his work was tossing them out. I put Linux on them, and it ran circles around Windows 2000 and Millennium on that low-end hardware. That experience taught me that the best software is software that's open for everyone to see, use, and that actually runs well on whatever you've got.\nFast forward to today, and I see the same pattern everywhere: GitLab, JFrog, Harbor, and others ship a limited \"community\" edition and then hide the features teams actually need behind some paywall. I get it — paychecks have to come from somewhere. But I wanted to prove that a fully-featured artifact registry could exist as genuinely open-source software. Every feature. No exceptions.\nThe specific features came from real pain points. Artifactory's search is painfully slow — that's why I integrated Meilisearch. Security scanning that doesn't require a separate enterprise license was another big one. And I wanted replication that didn't need a central coordinator — so I built a peer mesh where any node can replicate to any other node. I haven't deployed this at work yet — right now I'm running it at home for my personal projects — but I'd love to see it tested at scale, and that's a big part of why I'm sharing it here.\nThe AI story (I'm going to be honest about this):\nI built this in about three weeks using Claude Code. I know a lot of you will say this is probably vibe coding garbage — but if that's the case, it's an impressive pile of vibe coding garbage. Go look at the codebase. The backend is ~80% Rust with 429 unit tests, 33 PostgreSQL migrations, a layered architecture, and a full CI/CD pipeline with E2E tests, stress testing, and failure injection.\nAI didn't make the design decisions for me. I still had to design the WASM plugin system, figure out how the scanning engines complement each other, and architect the mesh replication. Years of domain knowledge drove the design — ",

The minimum stays light, but DB block cache, WAL write buffering, and active transaction state all add some baseline RAM (tens to a few hundreds of MB/node in practice);\n- Heavy load (many concurrent clients, transactions, or CDC enabled): Buffers, Raft logs, and transaction queues scale up, but you can cap these in config (batch size, CDC buffer, WAL fsync policy, etc);\n- Prometheus /metrics and admin API expose live stats, so you can observe resource use per node in production.\nIf you have a specific workload or dataset in mind, feel free to share it and I can benchmark or provide more precise figures!",

Raft alone is not enough for atomicity here, hence the 2PC overlay;\n- The design aims to illustrate real-world distributed transaction tradeoffs, not just basic data replication. It helps understand what you gain and lose with a layered model versus simpler replication like chain replication (which, as you noted, is more common for the data path in some object stores).\nSo yes, in a pure object store, consensus for data replication is often skipped in favor of lighter-weight methods. Here, the explicit Raft+2PC combo is an architectural choice for anyone learning, experimenting, or wanting strong, multi-shard atomicity. \nIn a production system focused only on throughput or simple durability, some of this could absolutely be streamlined.",

Everything was either expensive, too generic, or both. The workflows for a small-batch manufacturer aren’t that complex, but the pricing acts like they are.\nSo I built Craftplan. All the features were tailored to what she actually needed, and I figured other small-scale manufacturers (soap makers, breweries, candle makers, etc.) probably need the same things. So I’m putting it out there for free.\n - Live demo: https://craftplan.fly.dev (test@test.com / Aa123123123123)\n - GitHub: https://github.com/puemos/craftplan\n - Docs: https://puemos.github.io/craftplan\n - Self-hosting guide: https://puemos.github.io/craftplan/docs/self-hosting/\n \nWhat it does:\n - Product catalog with versioned recipes (BOMs) and automatic cost rollups across materials, labor, and overhead\n - Inventory tracking with lot traceability, expiry dates, allergen/nutrition flags, and demand forecasting\n - Order processing with calendar-based scheduling and allocation to production batches\n - Production planner with make sheets, material consumption from specific lots, and cost snapshots\n - Purchase orders with receiving workflow that auto-creates inventory lots\n - Basic CRM for customers and suppliers\n - CSV import/export, iCal calendar feed, JSON:API and GraphQL endpoints\n \nExperience building with Elixir, Ash and Liveview:\n - Speed: you get to test and improve things sooo fast. The DSL makes it simple to translate your thinking into live product\n - Extensibility: With Ash + LiveView you can add more features so easily. Adding JSON:API + Grapghql was a few minutes.\n - UX: I believe LiveView makes it simple to deliver great UX since it forcing you to keep things simple with no so much interaction overhead which most of the time means better and simple experience\n \nSelf-hosting:\n - Docker image: `ghcr.io/puemos/craftplan` (amd64 + arm64)\n - Docker Compose bundles PostgreSQL 16 + MinIO.\n\n \nOther details:\n - Email config from UI (SMTP, SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, Brevo, Amazon SES)\n - API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)\n - Role-based access (admin/staff)\n - Tech stack: Elixir, Ash Framework, Phoenix LiveView, PostgreSQL\n - License: AGPLv3\n\n \nFeedback welcome (and needed!)",

Everything is runtime inspectable and manipulable, and agents just automatically figure out what to do instantly. Debugging is very quick.\nAsh AI gives you automatically generated MCP servers that let agents call functions in your software, so you can prototype the backend without building any UI.\nOn top of that, the library ecosystem is battle-tested and encodes knowledge from decades of enterprise learnings. With agents, there's no reason to \"just use bash\" or \"just use a python script\" because it's easier for a human. You can just build an extremely robust application with high-level architecture patterns, self-healing, rich access permissions, minimal runtime mutation, etc. for free, because why not?\n(I have similar things to say about Rust with its algebraic typing, just, etc.)",

Existing solutions either require too much infrastructure (ELK), are SaaS-only, or don't support OpenTelemetr natively. Glintlog is meant to be the SQLite of log aggregation – simple, embedded, good enough for most use cases. I use a lot for ETL’s now… (I’m a data engineer too)…\nIt's not meant to replace SaaS that has a 500-person company. It's for small teams, and enthusiasts who want logs without the overhead, also covering all we need for it…\nDocs: https://glintlog.com/docs https://glintlog.com/docs \nGitHub: https://github.com/ibero-data/glintlog https://github.com/ibero-data/glintlog \nWould love feedback.

      "body_text": "I built MCPlexor to solve a token waste problem I kept running into with MCP-based agents.\nThe Problem:\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is great for giving LLMs access to external tools. But if you connect multiple servers (GitHub, Linear, Postgres, Slack), you end up with 40-50k tokens of tool definitions injected into every request – before the agent even does anything.\nOn a 200k context model, that's 25% gone. On smaller models, it's worse. And most runs only use 1-2 tools.\nThe Solution:\nMCPlexor sits between your agent and your MCP servers. Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront:\nAgent asks for a capability (\"create an issue\")\nMCPlexor routes to the right server using semantic matching\nOnly relevant tools get exposed\nResult: ~500 tokens overhead instead of ~20k.\nTechnical Details:\n- Written in Go, single binary, no runtime deps\n- Supports both stdio and HTTP transports\n- Stores credentials in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux keyring via zalando/go-keyring)\n- Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Augment Code, or any MCP-compatible client\nThe routing logic can run entirely locally using Ollama. No API calls, no cost, works offline.\nBusiness Model (for transparency):\n- Local/Ollama users: completely free\n- Cloud tier (on waitlist): we run inference on efficient small models instead of Opus/Pro, pass on savings, take a margin\nThe bet is that routing is a narrow enough task that a fine-tuned 7B model does it as well as a frontier model. Early testing suggests this works.\nCLI uploads: https://github.com/arustagi101/mcplexor https://github.com/arustagi101/mcplexor \nInstall: `curl -fsSL https://mcplexor.com/install.sh https://mcplexor.com/install.sh | bash`\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the routing approach, or anything else.",

There are many awesome RaspberryPi based projects out there but they're not for me.\nSo my approach was to: use off-the-shelf consumer products: a cheap tablet, a smart case etc. and write an app to push it as far as I can.\nI have created Homer Audio Player with the following assumptions and functionality:\n- it's meant for two users: a caregiver who manages content and a listener who controls only playback,\n- lockdown/kiosk mode - notifications, system navigation and other apps are hidden from the user - this converts an Android device to a dedicated device,\n- hidden settings section (optionally) - there's no chance for an accidental tap to \"break\" anything,\n- mainly for audiobooks, but will play anything,\n- simplified podcast support - the listener can choose only from a small number (1-5) of the most recent episodes,\n- unique features for older users, e.g. you can add extra screen margins to have more area to hold the device by,\n- balance between simplicity and functionality: you can enable/disable particular controls like volume, rewind etc.\nIn the end you get a robust audio device with simple user interface and some hidden smarts.\nIt has been battle‑tested by my grandmother for over ten years.\nTechnical stuff:\nKiosk mode is implemented with standard Android for enterprise functionality.\nThe device needs to be factory reset and set up as a \"company owned\" device by installing a special companion app.\nThe companion app is a device policy controller (DPC) that grants the Homer Audio Player app permissions to enable Android's \"lock task\". The player app can then pin itself to the screen. It's the regular \"task pinning\" but it can't be unpinned by user gestures, only by the app itself (which is exposed to the caregiver user in settings).\nIt's relatively friendly to non-technical users. The device can be reverted back to its original state by doing a factory reset.\nAndroid Docs: https://source.android.com/docs/devices/admin#fully-managed https://source.android.com/docs/devices/admin#fully-managed \nTouch screen as input device is not ideal for visually impaired users. It would be much better to have tactile buttons.\nBut I had to work with this limitation by using:\n- the accelerometer for \"flip-to-stop\" - placing the device with screen down stops playback,\n- 8\" tablet so that the buttons are large enough to see and hit even for low-vision users.\n- I haven't enabled TalkBack for my grandmother's device as I'm afraid it might be a bit too techy and requires relatively good motor skills. However buttons are properly labelled for accessibility services.\nText-to-speech comes free on Android for so many languages.",

What I have found is that running them is easy, reviewing the results, not so much. Each tool outputs different JSON, false positives pile up, and CI either becomes noisy or blocks everything.\nSo I built Kekkai (formerly Hokage), a small open-source CLI that wraps these scanners and focuses specifically on human triage.\nKekkai runs the scanners in isolated Docker containers, normalizes their outputs into a single format, and provides an interactive terminal UI to review findings, mark false positives, and save decisions locally.\nYou can try it out:\n```\npipx install kekkai-cli\nkekkai scan\nkekkai triage\n```\nWhat it currently does:\n- Runs Trivy (dependencies), Semgrep (code), and Gitleaks (secrets)\n- Normalizes findings into a unified report\n- Provides a keyboard-driven TUI for reviewing and marking findings\n- Supports .kekkaiignore for false positives\n- Has a CI mode with severity-based failure thresholds\nDesign choices:\n- Local-first by default (no SaaS required)\n- No proprietary scanning logic, it sits on top of existing tools\n- Scanners run in read-only, no-network Docker containers\nThis is still early and aimed at individual developers and small teams. The next things I’m working on are persistent triage state across runs (baselines) and better PR-level workflows.\nRepo and docs:\n https://github.com/kademoslabs/kekkai https://github.com/kademoslabs/kekkai \nI’m around to answer questions about tradeoffs, limitations, or why this exists at all.",

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nI'm George. I spent few months rebuilding Obooko, a free ebook platform that's been around since 2010 with 11 million downloads. Reading is losing to scrolling, but BookTok has 370B+ views. People want book content, they're just not reading books. I think that’s because modern reading hasn’t kept up with the pace of the internet.\nWhat I built\nObooko is ad-supported like YouTube. No paywall, no subscription, no account required. 4,000+ books across 30+ genres. You can read in the browser, sync across devices, or download as PDF/EPUB/Kindle.\nThe reader is built on EPUB.js ( https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js ). Frontend is vanilla JavaScript, no framework. Backend is Laravel handling progress tracking. The implementation uses continuous scrolling, font size controls (4 levels), chapter navigation, and persists reading progress to a pivot table via debounced API calls.\nIt's still MVP quality. I went with EPUB.js because it was simpler to integrate and I wanted to ship fast. Now that I'm getting user feedback, the reader is the biggest pain point. (Actually, more books is now the #1 request, but reader UX is close behind.) I'm probably going to switch to Readium ( https://github.com/readium https://github.com/readium ) which looks more robust but is more work to integrate.\nBeing a solo founder \nThis is my third startup but first time doing it alone. I scaled SmartrMail to exit and built Bluethumb to $100M+ in art sales, but both had co-founders. The day-to-day whiplash of switching between growth work and building product is rough. Some days I'm doing SEO audits and writing blog posts, emails, social. Other days I'm debugging PHP. It feels so hard to get everything covered off, and then I spent time building automations for it in Claude but wonder if I’m over automating.\nMaybe the hardest thing I’ve discovered as a solo founder is prioritisation and idea selection. I’m used to have someone to shoot down my dumb ideas. Now Claude just tells me every idea is amazing lol and I can get lost in a rabbit hole instead of really working on the most burning priority. And even daily taking stock of 100 to dos from backlog and working out which is #1, #2 is hard. Wondering how other solo founders do this better?\nAI audiobooks (and video books):\nI've built an MVP with ElevenLabs Voice API and the narration quality is great. But it's expensive. We've got close to 5,000 books and I can't afford to narrate them all that way yet. One idea I have is that once I build native iOS, the on-device voice APIs might be good enough to do narration on the fly. Then users could customise the voice to their preference. Obviously pretty dependent on where Apple get to with their native AI APIs and new devices.\nI also know we need a native app soon. The web reader is fine for casual browsing but serious readers want the Kindle experience: offline, fast, no browser chrome. That's a lot for one person to ship.\nWhat's next:\n* Adding",

Because the realities of being a developer have all but consumed my career with busywork.\nFor example, when I first learned about the borrow checker in Rust, it didn't make sense to me, because I had mostly already transitioned to data-driven development (just use immutable objects with copy-on-write and accept using twice the memory which is cheap anyway). I had the same feeling when I saw the syntactic sugar in Ruby, because it's solving problems which I specifically left behind when I abandoned C++. So I feel that those languages resonate with someone currently working with C-style code, but not, say, Lisp or SQL. We should be asking more of our compilers, not changing ourselves to suit them.\nWhich comes down to the academic vs pragmatic debate. Simple vs easy. Except that we've made the simple complex and the easy hard.\nSo I hold a lot of criticism for functional languages too. They all seem to demand that developers transpile the solution in their minds to stuff like prefix notation. Their syntax usually doesn't even look like equations. Always a heavy emphasis on pedantry, none on ergonomics. So that by the time solutions are written, we can't read them anyway.\nI believe that most of these problems would go away if we went back to first principles and wrote a developer-oriented language, but one that's formal with no magic.\nFor example, I would l",

      "body_text": "Hi everyone,\nI built a runtime to isolate untrusted code using wasm sandboxes.\nBasically, it protects your host system from problems that untrusted code can cause. We’ve had a great discussion about sandboxing in Python lately that elaborates a bit more on the problem [1]. In TypeScript, wasm integration is even more natural thanks to the close proximity between both ecosystems.\nThe core is built in Rust. On top of that, I use WASI 0.2 via wasmtime and the component model, along with custom SDKs that keep things as idiomatic as possible.\nFor example, in Python we have a simple decorator:\n from capsule import task\n\n @task(\n name=\"analyze_data\", \n compute=\"MEDIUM\",\n ram=\"512mb\",\n allowed_files=[\"./authorized-folder/\"],\n timeout=\"30s\", \n max_retries=1\n )\n def analyze_data(dataset: list) -> dict:\n \"\"\"Process data in an isolated, resource-controlled environment.\"\"\"\n # Your code runs safely in a Wasm sandbox\n return {\"processed\": len(dataset), \"status\": \"complete\"}\n \nAnd in TypeScript we have a wrapper:\n import { task } from \"@capsule-run/sdk\"\n\n export const analyze = task({\n name: \"analyzeData\", \n compute: \"MEDIUM\", \n ram: \"512mb\",\n allowedFiles: [\"./authorized-folder/\"],\n timeout: 30000, \n maxRetries: 1\n }, (dataset: number[]) => {\n return {processed: dataset.length, status: \"complete\"}\n });\n \nYou can set CPU (with compute), memory, filesystem access, and retries to keep precise control over your tasks.\nIt's still quite early, but I'd love feedback. I’ll be around to answer questions.\nGitHub: https://github.com/mavdol/capsule https://github.com/mavdol/capsule \n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46500510 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46500510",

JSON Integrity: It parses JSON, sanitizes values, and rebuilds it. It guarantees valid JSON output for your SIEM (ELK/Datadog).\n2. Entropy Detection: Uses context-aware entropy analysis to catch high-randomness strings.\n3.

The current setup is exactly what you're describing, a fully local verification with no phone-home behavior.\nThe CLI/GUI tools I'm building read your locally installed extensions, extract their IDs, and check them against the CSV (which you can clone/download). No data leaves your machine during the scan.\nThe only \"central\" piece is the GitHub-hosted CSV itself, which is just a static file anyone can audit, fork, or host themselves. No API calls, no telemetry, no server lookups.\nYou're right that this design prevents the verification tool from becoming an attack vector. Even if my repo got compromised, worst case is a bad CSV, your local scan process stays isolated.\nI'm also looking at surfacing critical permissions for locally installed extensions,things like \"access to all websites,\" \"read clipboard,\" etc. That way users can make informed decisions about what to keep based on what's actually authorized, even if an extension isn't in the malicious database yet.\nAppreciate the security-minded feedback.",

      "body_text": "Hi,\nI built Axiomeer, an open-source marketplace protocol for AI agents. The idea: instead of hardcoding tool integrations into every agent, agents shop a catalog at runtime, and the marketplace ranks, executes, validates, and audits everything.\nHow it works:\n- Providers publish products (APIs, datasets, model endpoints) via 10-line JSON manifests\n- Agents describe what they need in natural language or structured tags\n- The router scores all options by capability match (70%), latency (20%), cost (10%) with hard constraint filters\n- The top pick is executed, output is validated (citations required? timestamps?), and evidence quality is assessed deterministically\n- If the evidence is mock/fake/low-quality, the agent abstains rather than hallucinating\n- Every execution is logged as an immutable receipt\nThe trust layer is the part I think is missing from existing approaches. MCP standardizes how you connect to a tool server. Axiomeer operates one layer up: which tool, from which provider, and can you trust what came back?\nStack: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Ollama (local LLM, no API keys). v1 ships with weather providers (Open-Meteo + mocks). The architecture supports any HTTP endpoint that returns structured JSON.\nLooking for contributors to add real providers across domains (finance, search, docs, code execution). Each provider is ~30 lines + a manifest.",

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nAt Imbue, we’ve been following the rapid developments in the agent landscape and noticed that the way agents interact with third-party services on users’ behalf often leaves a lot to be desired. Integrations are ad hoc, complicated, context-heavy, and either unfriendly to non-technical users or tied to a lock-in of some sort.\nWe‘re experimenting with a command-line tool, Latchkey, that could be used by local agents targeted at non-technical users while avoiding remote intermediaries. As far as we know, this is the only existing approach at the intersection of these two goals.\nCore idea: Agents access APIs of third-party services by prepending ordinary `curl` calls with the `latchkey` command, like this:\n latchkey curl -X POST 'https://slack.com/api/conversations.create' \\\n -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n -d '{\"name\":\"something-urgent\"}'\n\n \nLatchkey then transparently injects credentials into these calls, prompting the user to log in via a browser pop-up when needed. Browser automation is used to extract an API token from the browser session once logged in.\nBenefits:\n* A single skill to integrate with all services.\n* Direct communication between the agent and the third-party service (no OAuth intermediary app needed).\n* Agents usable by non-technical users.\n* Secrets do not leak to logs or chat transcripts.\nWe believe this aligns with a vision of a decentralized future in which people don’t need to ask corporations for permission to use their own data. We imagine a lively ecosystem of local agents that people use freely, supported by a community helping each other keep these tools useful and functional.\nWe’re aware that this approach comes with some downsides, too, and would love your feedback.\nP.S.

Witnessing social divisions and bureaucratic limitations firsthand, I realized we need a new way for people to express their will without being “disposable.”\nTo address this, I designed the Virtual Protest Protocol (VPP) ? an open-source framework for large-scale, 2D avatar-based digital demonstrations.\nKey Features:\nBeyond Yes/No: Adds an \"Observe\" option for the silent majority\nEconomic Sustainability: Funds global activism through U.S. commercial operations and avatar creator royalties\nAI Moderation: LLMs maintain civil discourse in real-time\nPrivacy First: Minimal data retention ? only anonymous attributes, no personal IDs after the event\nI shared this with the Open Technology Fund (OTF) and received positive feedback. Now, I’m looking for software engineers, designers, and OSS collaborators to help implement this as a robust project. I am not seeking personal gain; my goal is to leave this infrastructure for the next generation.\nLinks:\nGitHub: https://github.com/voice-of-japan/Virtual-Protest-Protocol/blob/main/README.md https://github.com/voice-of-japan/Virtual-Protest-Protocol/b... \nProject Site: https://voice-of-japan.net https://voice-of-japan.net \nTechnical Notes:\nScalable 2D Rendering: 3?4 static frames per avatar, looped for movement\nCell-Based Grid System: Manages thousands of avatars efficiently, instantiates new cells as participation grows\nLow Barrier to Entry: Accessible on low-spec smartphones and low-bandwidth environments\nWe are looking for collaborators with expertise in:\nBackend/Real-Time Architecture: Node.js, Go, etc.\nFrontend/Canvas Rendering: Handling thousands of avatars\nAI Moderation / LLM Integration\nOSS Governance & Project Management\nIf you’re interested, have technical advice, or want to join the build, please check the GitHub link and reach out.

In a typical LaTeX project split across many .tex files, it’s awkward to get a quick, clean word-frequency view without gluing everything together or counting LaTeX commands/math as “words”.\nSo I built latex-wc, a small Python CLI that:\n- extracts tokens from LaTeX while ignoring common LaTeX “noise” (commands, comments, math, refs/cites, etc.)\n- can take a single .tex file or a directory and recursively scan all *.tex files\n- prints a combined report once (total words, unique words, top-N frequencies)\nFastest way to try it is `uvx latex-wc [path]` (file or directory). Feedback welcome, especially on edge cases where you think the heuristic filters are too aggressive or not aggressive enough.",

      "body_text": "I built a Chrome extension that generates noise traffic to dilute your browsing profile. Instead of trying to hide what you do online (increasingly difficult), it buries your\n real activity in a flood of decoy searches, page visits, and ad clicks across dozens of site categories.\n The core idea is signal dilution — the same principle behind chaff in radar countermeasures and differential privacy in data science. If you visit 50 pages today and Poisson\n visits 500 more on your behalf, anyone analyzing your traffic (ISP, data broker, ad-tech) sees noise, not signal.\n\n How it works:\n\n - Uses a Poisson process for scheduling, so timing looks like natural human browsing rather than mechanical intervals\n - Opens background tabs (never steals focus), injects a content script that scrolls, hovers, and clicks links to look realistic\n - Batches tasks within Chrome's 1-minute alarm minimum, dispatching at calculated Poisson offsets\n - Four intensity levels: ~18/hr to ~300/hr\n - Configurable search engines, task mix (search/browse/ad-click ratio), and site categories\n\n What it explicitly does NOT do:\n\n - No data collection, telemetry, or analytics\n - No external server communication\n - No access to your cookies, history, or real tabs\n - No accounts or personal information required\n\n Every URL it will ever visit is hardcoded in the source. Every action is logged in a live feed you can inspect. The whole thing is ~2,500 lines of commented JS.\n\n I know this approach has real limitations — it doesn't defeat browser fingerprinting, your ISP can still see the noise domains, and a sufficiently motivated adversary could\n potentially distinguish real traffic from generated traffic through timing analysis or behavioral patterns. This is one layer in a defense-in-depth approach, not a complete\n solution.\n\n Similar prior art: TrackMeNot (randomized search queries since 2006) and AdNauseam (clicks all ads to pollute profiles). Both from NYU researchers. Google banned AdNauseam from\n the Chrome Web Store, which says something.\n\n Code: https://github.com/Daring-Designs/poisson-extension\n\n Not on the Chrome Web Store — you load it unpacked.

The generated code looks reasonable until you run it, then signature verification fails, raw body handling is wrong, or the middleware order breaks everything.\nPostHog's research on LLM code generation ( https://posthog.com/blog/correct-llm-code-generation https://posthog.com/blog/correct-llm-code-generation ) found that agents produce more reliable code when referencing known-working examples rather than reconstructing from training data. That's the approach here.\n`webhook-skills` is a collection of provider-specific webhook implementations and best practices guides built on the Agent Skills spec (agentskills.io):\n - Runnable examples (currently Express, Next.js, FastAPI, with more frameworks coming)\n - Signature verification with provider-specific gotchas documented\n - Best-practice patterns: idempotency, error handling, retry logic\n - 11 providers at launch (Stripe, Shopify, GitHub, OpenAI, Clerk, Paddle, others), expanding based on my needs or requests.\n \nExample:\n # list skills\n npx skills add hookdeck/webhook-skills --list\n\n # install skills\n npx skills add hookdeck/webhook-skills --skill stripe-webhooks --skill webhook-handler-patterns\n \nWorks with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot. The examples are useful even without an agent: minimal, tested handlers you can copy directly.\nPRs welcome for new providers and frameworks.

For real server deploys, there’s a provision script that sets up Docker + Traefik and a create-instance script to add more users and give them their own OpenClaws.\nRough sizing: each instance needs ~4 GB RAM, so an 8 GB VPS fits ~2, 16 GB fits ~4, etc. If you’ve already got a VPS sitting around, you just need a domain pointed at it (wildcard DNS A record) and the provision script handles the rest: installs Docker, sets up Traefik, automates SSL. Way cheaper than managed OpenClaw hosting and you actually own the infra.\nOpen to hearing feedback, anyone else self-hosting this vs using managed hosting?",

      "body_text": "Hello HN. I'm Maxime, founder at LimaCharlie ( https://limacharlie.io https://limacharlie.io ), a Hyperscaler for SecOps (access building blocks you need to build security operations, like AWS does for IT).\nWe’ve engineered a new product on our platform that solves a timely issue acting as a guardrail between your AI and the world: Viberails ( https://www.viberails.io https://www.viberails.io )\nThis won't be new to folks here, but we identified 4 challenges teams face right now with AI tools:\n 1. Auditing what the tools are doing.\n 2. Controlling toolcalls (and their impact on the world).\n 3. Centralized management.\n 4. Easy access to the above.\n \nTo expand:\nAudit logs are the bread and butter for security, but this hasn't really caught up in AI tooling yet. Being able to look back and say \"what actually happened\" after the fact is extremely valuable during an incident and for compliance purposes.\nTool calls are how LLMs interact with the world, we should be able to exercise basic controls over them like: don't read credential files, don't send emails out, don't create SSH keys etc. Being able to not only see those calls but also block them is key for preventing incidents.\nAs soon as you move beyond a single contributor on one box, the issue becomes: how do I scale processes by creating an authoritative config for the team. Having one spot with all the audit, detection and control policies becomes critical. It's the same story as snowflake-servers.\nFinally, there's plenty of companies that make products that partially address this, but they fall in one of two buckets:\n - They don't handle the \"centralized\" point above, meaning they just send to syslog and leave all the messy infra bits to you.\n - They are locked behind \"book a demo\", sales teams, contracts and all the wasted energy that goes with that.\n \nWe made Viberails address these problems. Here's what it is:\n - OpenSource client, written in Rust\n - Curl-to-bash install, share a URL with your team to join your Team, done. Linux, MacOS and Windows support.\n - Detects local AI tools, you choose which ones you want to install. We install hooks for each relevant platform. The hooks use the CLI tool. We support all the major tools (including OpenClaw).\n - The CLI tool sends webhooks into your Team (tenant, called Organization in LC) in LimaCharlie. The tool-related hooks are blocking to allow for control.\n - Blocking webhooks have around 50ms RTT.\n - Your tenant in LC records the interaction for audit.\n - We create an initial set of detection rules for you as examples. They do not block by default. You can create your own rules, no opaque black boxes.\n - You can view the audit, the alerts, etc. in the cloud.\n - You can setup outputs to send audits, blocking events and detections to all kinds of other platforms of your choosing. Easy mode of this is coming, right now this is done in the main LC UI and not the simplified Viberails view.\n - The detection/blocking rules support all kinds of operators",

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nI've been using OpenClaw for a few months as my local LLM gateway. It was genuinely fun — the convenience of routing multiple models through a single endpoint is hard to beat. But along the way, I stumbled upon a few surprises that made me uncomfortable:\n- Config files scattered in unexpected places (~/.openclaw, ~/.clawdbot, and more)\n- Background processes that respawn after termination\n- Logs that quietly accumulate without rotation\n- Cached data persisting long after I thought I'd removed it\nNone of this is necessarily malicious, but when I decided to move on, I wanted a clean break — not leftover artifacts haunting my system.\nSo I built OpenShears: a CLI tool that scans, detects, and removes all traces of OpenClaw. It's intentionally aggressive but always asks for confirmation before deleting anything.\nThis is fully open source (MIT). If you've found other hidden files or processes that OpenShears missed, PRs are very welcome. Let's make this the definitive cleanup tool.",

Staging is shared and often broken. Pulling to local setups are a pain. So PRs get a quick code skim and a \"LGTM.\"\nVeilStream spins up isolated preview environments from your `docker-compose.yml`, (optionally) complete with a sanitized snapshot of your production database.\n## What happens when you open PR #247\n1. GitHub webhook hits our API\n2. We pull your branch and parse your compose file\n3. Kubernetes manifests render from your compose services (and applied to our cluster)\n4. A fresh namespace gets created with your containers\n5. Optionally, postgres containers are seeded with your data\n6. Health checks pass, you get a stable URL: `https://<unique-string>.env.veilstreamapp.com`\n7. that link is commented back on any open PRs from that branch\nTotal time from push to working environment: about 2 minutes.\n### The reviewer experience\nYour teammate clicks the link. They're using your app with real data structure, real relationships, real edge cases—but emails are fake, SSNs are masked, and PII never leaves your production boundary.\nNo shared staging. No \"wait, who's testing on staging right now?\" No stepping on each other's test data. No risk to prod.\n### When PR #247 gets merged or closed\nThe namespace, containers, and database are automatically destroyed. Nothing lingers.\n## What it's not\n- Not serverless/edge - this is for apps that run containers\n- Not a Vercel competitor - we're focused on the full stack from a docker-compose perspective\n- Not a database replication tool - the proxy works like a man-in-the-middle, not on the WAL\n## MCP Server for AI Agents\nWe built an MCP server so Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding agents can deploy preview environments directly. Your agent can spin up an environment, run tests against it, and tear it down—all without leaving your editor.\n## Tech Stack\n- Backend : Go (API + reconciler)\n- Frontend : React + TypeScript\n- Infrastructure : Kubernetes, with dynamic namespace provisioning\n- Database proxy : Custom Go proxy that interfaces with a database, and exposes the standard psql wire protocol, mimicing a server\n## Links\n- Landing page: https://www.veilstream.com https://www.veilstream.com \n- Application: https://app.veilstream.com https://app.veilstream.com \n- Example project: https://github.com/veilstream/example-music-company https://github.com/veilstream/example-music-company \n- Demo video: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonessteven_i-have-only-made-this-letter-longer-because-activity-7422806480107651073-R9BM https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonessteven_i-have-only-made-... \n- Docs: https://docs.veilstream.com https://docs.veilstream.com \nHappy to answer questions.\nAlso: htaccess-style password protection is available for your preview environments.",

Instead of maintaining separate hand-written state machines in each component, you define interaction once as a global choreography and project role-local behavior at compile time. At runtime, only valid protocol transitions are executable, so invalid moves such as skipping, reusing, or taking the wrong branch are rejected by the protocol model.\nThe practical value is that one global source of truth replaces multiple hand-written state machines and removes a class of protocol-drift bugs.\nCore repo: https://github.com/hibanaworks/hibana https://github.com/hibanaworks/hibana \nOne concrete example is hibana-agent, which demonstrates the same model on an AI agent workflow: allowed action paths are defined in choreography, and only those transitions are executable at runtime.\nExample app: https://github.com/hibanaworks/hibana-agent https://github.com/hibanaworks/hibana-agent",

      "body_text": "Over the past couple of months I've been working on a TUI framework heavily inspired\nby Flutter, written in Dart.\nThe API is modeled after Flutter. StatefulComponent, setState(), Row, Column,\nExpanded, ListView.\nThere have been some discussions about performance of TUIs recently, and I think Dart is\nactually a great language for writing TUIs in. It compiles down to fast native code, is\ncross-platform, and has great developer ergonomics. JIT compilation for development\n(which enables hot reload) and AOT compilation for production binaries.\nWhat's really cool is stateful hot reload. If you save your file with some modification, Nocterm\nwill pick it up and update the TUI in real time without restarting.\nUnder the hood:\n- Differential rendering: virtual terminal buffer, only redraws changed cells\n- Declarative component model (same as Flutter): Component → Element → RenderObject pipeline\n- 45+ components: layout, scrolling, text input, markdown, animations, mouse support\n- Built-in test framework: pump a component, send keys, assert on terminal state\n- Theming: 6 built-in themes, auto-detects terminal dark/light mode\nExample:\nvoid main() async {\n await runApp(Counter());\n}\nclass Counter extends StatefulComponent {\n int _count = 0;\n Component build(BuildContext context) {\n return Focusable(\n onKeyEvent: (event) {\n if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKey.space) {\n setState(() => _count++);\n return true;\n }\n return false;\n },\n child: Center(child: Text('Count: $_count')),\n );\n } \n}\nI tried a couple of existing TUI frameworks but missed the Flutter DX I've learned\nto love, so I built my own (for better or worse...).\nI've been using Nocterm to build vide_cli ( https://github.com/Norbert515/vide_cli https://github.com/Norbert515/vide_cli ),\na coding agent in the terminal.\nThere's some cool stuff coming up too, like virtual text selection in alternate screen\nmode. Since TUI apps take over the terminal, normal text selection breaks. This\nreimplements it at the framework level so users can select and copy text naturally.\nRepository: https://github.com/Norbert515/nocterm https://github.com/Norbert515/nocterm \nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, hot reload implementation, or\nanything else.",

      "body_text": "I've been a photons-on-glass filmmaker for over ten years, and I've been developing ArtCraft for myself, my friends, and my colleagues.\nAll of my film school friends have a lot of ambition, but the production pyramid doesn't allow individual talent to shine easily. 10,000 students go to film school, yet only a handful get to helm projects they want with full autonomy - and almost never at the blockbuster budget levels that would afford the creative vision they want. There's a lot of nepotism, too.\nAI is the personal computer moment for film. The DAW.\nOne of my friends has done rotoscoping with live actors:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4 \nThe Corridor folks show off a lot of creativity with this tech:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXY \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq5JaG53dho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq5JaG53dho \nWe've been making silly shorts ourselves:\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqoCWdOwr2U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqoCWdOwr2U \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4NFXGMuwpY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4NFXGMuwpY \nThe secret is that a lot of studios have been using AI for well over a year now. You just don't notice it, and they won't ever tell you because of the stigma. It's the \"bad toupee fallacy\" - you'll only notice it when it's bad, and they'll never tell you otherwise.\nComfy is neat, but I work with folks that don't intuit node graphs and that either don't have graphics cards with adequate VRAM, or that can't manage Python dependencies. The foundation models are all pretty competitive, and they're becoming increasingly controllable - and that's the big thing - control. So I've been working on the UI/UX control layer.\nArtCraft has 2D and 3D control surfaces, where the 3D portion can be used as a strong and intuitive ControlNet for \"Image-to-Image\" (I2I) and \"Image-to-Video\" (I2V) workflows. It's almost like a WYSIWYG, and I'm confident that this is the direction the tech will evolve for creative professionals rather than text-centric prompting.\nI've been frustrated with tools like Gimp and Blender for a while. I'm no UX/UI maestro, but I've never enjoyed complicated tools - especially complicated OSS tools. Commercial-grade tools are better. Figma is sublime. An IDE for creatives should be simple, magical, and powerful.\nArtCraft lets you drag and drop from a variety of creative canvases and an asset drawer easily. It's fast and intuitive. Bouncing between text-to-image for quick prototyping, image editing, 3d gen, to 3d compositing is fluid. It feels like \"crafting\" rather than prompting or node graph wizardry.\nArtCraft, being a desktop app, lets us log you into 3rd party compute providers. I'm a big proponent of using and integrating the models you subscribe to wherever you have them. This has let us integrate Worl",

      "body_text": "A few weeks ago I posted about GoodToGo https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656759 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656759 - a tool that gives AI agents a deterministic answer to \"is this PR ready to merge?\" Several people asked about the larger orchestration system I mentioned. This is that system.\nI got tired of being a project manager for Claude Code. It writes code fine, but shipping production code is seven or eight jobs — research, planning, design review, implementation, code review, security audit, PR creation, CI babysitting. I was doing all the coordination myself. The agent typed fast. I was still the bottleneck. What I really needed was an orchestrator of orchestrators - swarms of swarms of agents with deterministic quality checks.\nSo I built metaswarm. It breaks work into phases and assigns each to a specialist swarm orchestrator. It manages handoffs and uses BEADS for deterministic gates that persist across /compact, /clear, and even across sessions. Point it at a GitHub issue or brainstorm with it (it uses Superpowers to ask clarifying questions) and it creates epics, tasks, and dependencies, then runs the full pipeline to a merged PR - including outside code review like CodeRabbit, Greptile, and Bugbot.\nThe thing that surprised me most was the design review gate. Five agents — PM, Architect, Designer, Security, CTO — review every plan in parallel before a line of code gets written. All five must approve. Three rounds max, then it escalates to a human. I expected a rubber stamp. It catches real design problems, dependency issues, security gaps.\nThis weekend I pointed it at my backlog. 127 PRs merged. Every one hit 100% test coverage. No human wrote code, reviewed code, or clicked merge. OK, I guided it a bit, mostly helping with plans for some of the epics.\nA few learnings:\nAgent checklists are theater. Agents skipped coverage checks, misread thresholds, or decided they didn't apply. Prompts alone weren't enough. The fix was deterministic gates — BEADS, pre-push hooks, CI jobs all on top of the agent completion check. The gates block bad code whether or not the agent cooperates.\nThe agents are just markdown files. No custom runtime, no server, and while I built it on TypeScript, the agents are language-agnostic. You can read all of them, edit them, add your own.\nIt self-reflects too. After every merged PR, the system extracts patterns, gotchas, and decisions into a JSONL knowledge base. Agents only load entries relevant to the files they're touching. The more it ships, the fewer mistakes it makes. It learns as it goes.\nmetaswarm stands on two projects: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads https://github.com/steveyegge/beads by Steve Yegge (git-native task tracking and knowledge priming) and https://github.com/obra/superpowers https://github.com/obra/superpowers by Jesse Vincent (disciplined agentic workflows — TDD, brainstorming, systematic debugging).

      "body_text": "Hi HN!, So, We are working on an open source Linux distribution called CodeVerse Linux. It is a community project built by developers from The CodeVerse Hub.\nThe idea is simple: A minimal, fast, Arch based OS that is Wayland first and actually enjoyable for developers and power users.\nwe are not trying to be the next omarchy or the next big thing, but we have a lot of passion for what we do, after all, we are all learners ourselves.\nthe distro has sane defaults while not being very bloated and its fully open source\nwe are doing this for the purpose of giving everyone a change to contribute what they can, becoming the opportunity for many to make their first meaningful contribution. This project will continue to evolve and we aim to make it something that is built by learners for learners. So expect misconducts and mistakes in the code-base\nWe are open to: Feedback, Contributors, Suggestions and Criticism (constructive)\nthanks for reading this and have a good one",

      "body_text": "I built a \"Triple Failover\" RAG for Singapore Laws, then rewrote the logic based on your feedback.\nHi everyone!\nI’m a student developer. Recently, I created Explore Singapore, a RAG-based search engine that scrapes about 20,000 pages of Singaporean government acts and laws.\nI recently posted the MVP and received some tough but essential feedback about hallucinations and query depth. I took that feedback, focused on improvements, and just released Version 2.\nHere is how I upgraded the system from a basic RAG to a production-grade one.\nThe Design & UI\nI aimed to avoid a dull government website.\nDesign: Heavily inspired by Apple’s minimalist style.\nTech: Custom frontend interacting with a Python backend.\nThe V2 Engineering Overhaul\nThe community challenged me on three main points. Here’s how I addressed them:\n1. The \"Personality\" Fix\nIssue: I use a \"Triple Failover\" system with three models as backup. When the main model failed, the backups sounded entirely different.\nThe Solution: I added Dynamic System Instructions. Now, if the backend switches to Model B, it uses a specific prompt designed for Model B’s features, making it mimic the structure and tone of the primary model. The user never notices the change.\n2. The \"Deep Search\" Fix\nIssue: A simple semantic search for \"Starting a business\" misses related laws like \"Tax\" or \"Labor\" acts.\nThe Solution: I implemented Multi-Query Retrieval (MQR). An LLM now intercepts your query. It breaks it down into sub-intents (e.g., “Business Registration,” “Corporate Tax,” “Employment Rules”). It searches for all of them at the same time and combines the results.\nResult: Much richer, context-aware answers.\n3. The \"Hallucination\" Fix\nIssue: Garbage In, Garbage Out. If FAISS retrieves a bad document, the LLM produces inaccurate information.\nThe Solution: I added a Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking layer.\nStep 1: FAISS grabs the top 10 results.\nStep 2: A specialized Cross-Encoder model evaluates them for relevance.\nStep 3: Irrelevant parts are removed before they reach the Chat LLM.\n*\nThe Tech Stack\n*\nEmbeddings: BGE-M3 (Running locally)\nVector DB: FAISS\nBackend: Python + Custom Triple-Model Failover\nLogic: Multi-Query + Re-Ranking (New in V2)\nTry it out\nI am still learning. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the new logic.\nLive Demo: https://adityaprasad-sudo.github.io/Explore-Singapore/ https://adityaprasad-sudo.github.io/Explore-Singapore/ \nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/adityaprasad-sudo/Explore-Singapore https://github.com/adityaprasad-sudo/Explore-Singapore \nFeedback, especially on the failover speed, is welcome!",

There have been 1,800+ exposed agent gateways discovered in the wild and recent security audits showing multiple vulnerabilities in agent frameworks, so this was motivated by the clear urgent need for better controls.\nImplementation is simple: a CLI wrapper around MCP servers that takes a few minutes to set up. You can do it through your dashboard or with quick command (npx @latchhq/cli wrap)\nKey features:\nPolicy engine using natural language rules, or create rule-based policies by tool name, action class, or domain.\nAudit logging\nTelegram integration for mobile approvals\nThe project addresses what security researchers call the \"lethal trifecta\" - when AI agents have access to private data, process untrusted content, and can communicate externally. This creates a new attack vector traditional security tools don't address.\nI think the space is wide open and looking for contributors!\nGitHub: https://github.com/latchagent/latch https://github.com/latchagent/latch \nDocs: https://latch.mintlify.app https://latch.mintlify.app",

They're either too slow, make real-time collaboration painful during live incidents, or force you to fight with different log formats instead of actually investigating.\nWhat Gulp does differently:\n- Visual timeline analysis — Our color-coded timeline visualization lets you spot anomalies instantly. Instead of drowning in raw logs, suspicious events, correlations, and IoCs literally jump out at you. Different colors tell different stories; one look tells you where to dig.\n- Actually fast — Built on OpenSearch 3.x, PostgreSQL and Redis. Horizontal scaling via load-balanced instances when you need to handle serious volume.\n- Real-time collaboration — Multiple analysts working the same incident, synchronized timelines, shared notes. No more \"wait, which events were you looking at?\"\n- Native format support — EVTX, PCAP, Suricata, Zeek, ElasticSearch, Wazuh, and more out of the box. Plus ECS mapping, SIGMA rules, and OpenSearch queries.\n- AI-powered hunting — Built-in AI Assistant plugin (free in Community Edition) that flags suspicious events and correlates across sources. One click to find shared indicators.\nNew in 1.6.0: Rewritten collaboration engine with WebSocket-based real-time updates, real-time network sensor ingestion (see https://github.com/mentat-is/slurp-ebpf https://github.com/mentat-is/slurp-ebpf for a working eBPF example), new plugins (Suricata, MemprocFS, Zeek, AI Assistant), manual query mode + table view, and auto-saved sessions.\nGulp uses an open core model. The Community Edition is fully open source (AGPL). We also offer a Pro version with advanced plugins for better AI features, automated reporting, Velociraptor integration, plus dedicated support.\nRepos: https://github.com/mentat-is/gulp https://github.com/mentat-is/gulp (backend) and https://github.com/mentat-is/gulpui-web https://github.com/mentat-is/gulpui-web (web UI)\nHandling an incident with Gulp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl_jtCIIS2k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl_jtCIIS2k \nThis is our first major public push — we've been iterating quietly and now feel it's ready for wider use. If you do DFIR or threat hunting, we'd genuinely love your feedback. GitHub stars, issues, and PRs absolutely welcome!",

      "body_text": "Hi HN.\nOpenClaw has been popping claw for weeks now…\nWe’ve seen the same question come up again and again:\n“This is fun but how do we no get fuk?”\nMy answer: Clawdstrike.\nIt’s an open-source toolbox for developers who want to ship EDR-style apps and security infrastructure to the OpenClaw ecosystem.\nDisclaimer: this is an unpublished alpha (APIs will change). Beta is planned within ~7 days (aiming for Feb 10, 2026). Not audited—please treat as experimental.\nHere’s my take: the first wave of “make autonomous agents safe where users are literally yoloing their entire system without even watching” is actually pretty simple.\nSecurity needs to live at the boundary between an agent’s intent and action — the moment it tries to read/write files, patch code, call tools, or reach the network.\nNot just “visibility.” Not just logs. But enforcement + proof.\nWhat Clawdstrike gives you:\n- Fail-closed guards at the agent/tool boundary\n- Block sensitive paths, control network egress, detect secrets, validate patches, restrict tools, catch jailbreaks\n- A policy engine (YAML rulesets) so teams can start safe and tighten over time\n- Receipts + signatures (Ed25519) so wtf the agent actually did is verifiable — not a story in your log pipeline\n- An OpenClaw plugin so this drops into existing stacks with minimal friction\nEveryone knows this turns into a forever cat-and-mouse game between model providers, agent frameworks, sandbox/runtime developers, and the adversaries. That’s the world we’re in. (boo. fuck you, bad guys.)\nMy hope is Clawdstrike becomes a useful foundation for people in the ecosystem: a place where developers and security people can encode + share proving strategies (guards, policies, verification patterns) instead of each team re-learning the same lessons in private.\nThreat model (explicit, so nobody gets misled):\nClawdstrike enforces policy at the agent/tool boundary. It is *NOT* an OS sandbox and does *NOT* intercept syscalls. If an agent can bypass the tool layer and touch the filesystem/network directly, gg, Clawdstrike can’t stop it. The intended setup is: pair this with OS/container sandboxing when you need syscall-level isolation (seccomp/gVisor/Firecracker/etc).\nWhy I’m posting:\nI want to do whatever I can to help build out the shared safety layer for the OpenClaw ecosystem. If this looks useful to you: clawdstrike is something you can adopt early and extend, help us help you build serious security/EDR-grade infrastructure on top of it.\nFeedback I’d love:\n- Which single failure mode scares you most with OpenClaw today?\n - (exfiltration, destructive writes, supply-chain via patches, prompt/tool injection, credential leakage, lateral movement, etc.)\n- If this becomes a shared safety layer, what needs to be stable?\n - Unfortunately for you all I’ve never built a widely adopted open source security sdk, so really just looking for feedback on release cadence and stability from those who would plan on using something like this.\nPolicy schema? guard ",

Over the years, I watched design tools evolve from lightweight products into bloated feature-heavy platforms. I kept finding myself using a small amount of the features while the rest just mostly got in the way.\nSo a few years ago I set out to build a design tool just like I wanted. So I built Vecti with what I actually need: pixel-perfect grid snapping, a performant canvas renderer, shared asset libraries, and export/presentation features. No collaborative whiteboarding. No plugin ecosystem. No enterprise features. Just the design loop.\nFour years later, I can proudly show it off. Built and hosted in the EU with European privacy regulations. Free tier available (no credit card, one editor forever).\nOn privacy: I use some basic analytics (page views, referrers) but zero tracking inside the app itself. No session recordings, no behavior analytics, no third-party scripts beyond the essentials.\nIf you're a solo designer or small team who wants a tool that stays out of your way, I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback:\n https://vecti.com https://vecti.com \nHappy to answer questions about the tech stack, architecture decisions, why certain features didn't make the cut, or what's next.",

      "body_text": "I found myself disagreeing with almost all of the comments on the “AI Is Killing B2B SaaS” thread [1], based on my perspective as a senior PM (~20 years in SaaS) at a massive system of record (SoR) company in California. We’re still cooked. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\nBigCo SoRs, differences aside, have historically been a good, low-drama way to make a living in tech. RSUs, ~40-hour weeks, generally smart colleagues, and real problems to solve for F100 customers. Our products work, but are not loved. Enterprise sales runs the show.\nI have no concerns about a scrappy AI startup or indie dev replacing us. The real threat is other SoR vendors, the cloud providers, and of course the AI labs themselves. All of them are coming for our SaaS margins, and as an industry we are woefully unprepared.\nEvery major SoR has its core competency (HR, ERP, CRM, etc.), but also a long tail of lesser-known portfolio products that increasingly overlap with other SoRs and serve as growth vectors. The competition here is only going to accelerate. As a huge enterprise, you’re not going to rip out a component your SoR for a cool startup or a vibe-coded internal tool... but you would seriously consider doing so if the alternative comes from another SoR vendor you use and is cheaper.\nThe public cloud providers are explicitly positioning themselves as the place where your business data, AI agents/LLMs, and critical applications live. This is on a direct collision course with SoRs’ own AI platform ambitions that they are banking on for growth.\nThe AI labs themselves have the same ambition. Note where systems of record sit in OpenAI’s Frontier press release marketecture: a dotted, nearly invisible line at the bottom [2].\nSoRs aren’t dead, and they’re not being disrupted by vibe coders. But the path forward is brutal.\nWhich brings me to the hardest point that applies to me as well. SoR teams are not known for fast execution, cutting edge AI adoption, product taste, or engineering excellence. These are exactly the strengths of our new competitors. We also struggle to attract this kind of talent. People who fit that profile go to FAANG or the labs. We could try to compete with RSUs, but those are down ~50% over the past few months, and the industry is under increasing pressure from investors around stock-based comp and M&A in general.\nThe goal here is an honest take from someone on the inside. There’s a difficult road ahead. I think SoRs will always continue to exist in some form but I don’t think the recent market corrections are overblown.\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46888441 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46888441 \n[2] https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/ https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/",

Please post something with more substance here.\nWe all notice a shift in the general perception of the SaaS industry. People are afraid, massive change is coming. But that is obvious from all the posts in news outlets, on x, on Reddit etc.\nThus far it’s just a massive hype. The technology has the potential to switch up the business, for sure, but now apart from frontier labs for everyone else it’s just eating money. No company has lost clients due to being replaced by some autonomous agent.\nDon’t get me wrong, the technology has the potential, and it will improve, and we will see massive changes. Money will flow to different entities (cloud providers? New players? Who knows). But technology still needs to be shaped into a useful product. Even for coding (undoubtedly the most mature use case for AI agents) the agents still have to demonstrate they actually safe time and money in the long run. So far it looks like they mostly create more work.",

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nMy friend and I have been experimenting with using LLMs to reason about biotech stocks. Unlike many other sectors, Biotech trading is largely event-driven: FDA decisions, clinical trial readouts, safety updates, or changes in trial design can cause a stock to 3x in a single day ( https://www.biotradingarena.com/cases/MDGL_2023-12-14_Resmetirom_NASH https://www.biotradingarena.com/cases/MDGL_2023-12-14_Resmet... ).\nInterpreting these ‘catalysts,’ which comes in the form of a press release, usually requires analysts with previous expertise in biology or medicine. A catalyst that sounds “positive” can still lead to a selloff if, for example:\nthe effect size is weaker than expected\n- results apply only to a narrow subgroup\n- endpoints don’t meaningfully de-risk later phases,\n- the readout doesn’t materially change approval odds.\nTo explore this, we built BioTradingArena, a benchmark for evaluating how well LLMs can interpret biotech catalysts and predict stock reactions. Given only the catalyst and the information available before the date of the press release (trial design, prior data, PubMed articles, and market expectations), the benchmark tests to see how accurate the model is at predicting the stock movement for when the catalyst is released.\nThe benchmark currently includes 317 historical catalysts. We also created subsets for specific indications (with the largest in Oncology) as different indications often have different patterns. We plan to add more catalysts to the public dataset over the next few weeks. The dataset spans companies of different sizes and creates an adjusted score, since large-cap biotech tends to exhibit much lower volatility than small and mid-cap names.\nEach row of data includes:\n- Real historical biotech catalysts (Phase 1–3 readouts, FDA actions, etc.) and pricing data from the day before, and the day of the catalyst\n- Linked Clinical Trial data, and PubMed pdfs\nNote, there are may exist some fairly obvious problems with our approach. First, many clinical trial press releases are likely already included in the LLMs’ pretraining data. While we try to reduce this by ‘de-identifying each press release’, and providing only the data available to the LLM up to the date of the catalyst, there are obviously some uncertainties about whether this is sufficient.\nWe’ve been using this benchmark to test prompting strategies and model families. Results so far are mixed but interesting as the most reliable approach we found was to use LLMs to quantify qualitative features and then a linear regression of these features, rather than direct price prediction.\nJust wanted to share this with HN. I built a playground link for those of you who would like to play around with it in a sandbox. Would love to hear some ideas and hope people can play around with this!",

Today we are sharing Tabstack Research, an API for multi-step web discovery and synthesis.\n https://tabstack.ai/blog/tabstack-research-verified-answers https://tabstack.ai/blog/tabstack-research-verified-answers \nIn many agent systems, there is a clear distinction between extracting structured data from a single page and answering a question that requires reading across many sources. The first case is fairly well served today. The second usually is not.\nMost teams handle research by combining search, scraping, and summarization. This becomes brittle and expensive at scale. You end up managing browser orchestration, moving large amounts of raw text just to extract a few claims, and writing custom logic to check if a question was actually answered.\nWe built Tabstack Research to move this reasoning loop into the infrastructure layer. You send a goal, and the system:\n- Decomposes it into targeted sub-questions to hit different data silos.\n- Navigates the web using fetches or browser automation as needed.\n- Extracts and verifies claims before synthesis to keep the context window focused on signal.\n- Checks coverage against the original intent and pivots if it detects information gaps.\nFor example, if a search for enterprise policies identifies that data is fragmented across multiple sub-services (like Teams data living in SharePoint), the engine detects that gap and automatically pivots to find the missing documentation.\nThe goal is to return something an application can rely on directly: a structured object with inline citations and direct links to the source text, rather than a list of links or a black-box summary.\nThe blog post linked above goes into more detail on the engine architecture and the technical challenges of scaling agentic browsing.\nWe have a free tier that includes 50,000 credits per month so you can test it without a credit card: https://console.tabstack.ai/signup https://console.tabstack.ai/signup \nI would love to get your feedback on the approach and answer any questions about the stack.",

Audit-Ready Citations: Every answer is grounded in primary sources—IRC Title 26, Treasury Regs, and IRS guidance, providing verified references you can actually defend.\n2. Context-Aware Intelligence: Beyond answering queries, the system flags related risks, exceptions, and filing deadlines that practitioners might overlook.\n3. Compliance: We are SOC 2 compliant with a strict zero-training policy on sensitive client data.\nWe’re curious to hear from anyone else building RAG for \"dense\" domains where \"close enough\" results are not enough. We'll be in the comments to talk about our indexing strategy and how we handle complex document extraction.\nSokratis",

      "body_text": "Hi HN, the creator of MemeOS here.\nI built MemeOS because I was tired of the current state of meme generators. Most existing mobile apps / websites are either riddled with ads, have outdated templates, or are just simple image captioners without real editing power.\nMemeOS is a native iOS app designed to treat memes as a serious medium. I wanted to build something that feels like a \"pro\" tool but for something as fun as memes.\nKey Features:\nAI Meme Maker: I built an agentic workflow using Supabase Vector Search. You can describe a situation or feeling, and my \"Meme Maker Agent\" (yes, I really built a meme agent!) will find relevant templates and suggest captions.\nProfessional Editor: Layer-based editing, and precise text controls. It feels more like a mini-Photoshop for memes than a simple captioner.\nMeme Lore: Every meme has an origin story. I use AI to research and write the history (\"lore\") of each template, so you know exactly where it came from and how to use it correctly.\nThe Tech Stack:\nBackend: Supabase (PostgreSQL).\nFrontend: SwiftUI (100% native iOS).\nAI/Search: Supabase Vector for semantic search of templates and RAG for the \"Lore\" generation.\nEdge Functions: Deno runtime for the heavy lifting of AI coordination.\nThe app is free to try. I monetize through a separate subscription for power users (AI tools, premium assets, watermark removal), but the detailed Meme Lore and the core editor are accessible to everyone.\nYou can check it out here:\nWebsite: https://memeos.app https://memeos.app \nDownload (iOS): https://memeos.app/download https://memeos.app/download \nI’d love to hear your feedback on the editing feel. I am actively tweaking the vector search weights, so any examples where the AI \"missed\" the vibe would be super helpful!",

I was happy, but the most upvoted comments on the thread were asking for the app to be open sourced, since it dealt with system-wide notifications. My promises weren't good enough, and the community wanted more!\nWhy didn't I open source it in the first place? Linux has been by primary driver for more than a decade. I genuinely believe in the philosophy, and have always wanted to give back to the community. The primary reason, probably, was because I was ashamed that I had 90% vibe-coded the app. More than 2 decades of writing software, and my first contribution to FOSS would be AI-generated code? Would it withstand even the most minimal of scrutiny? Would by (unknown) name forever be tarnished? I exaggerate, but only slightly :)\nSo, yesterday, after a fair bit of trepidation, I changed the github repo visibility to public and put up a announcement on the app's website [1]. I have also submitted the app to F-Droid [2].

Because we have actual people out there who hate us and want to take everything away from us and then rule over us all and start disappearing the other-minded people during the cold of the night.

Legally, if I simply sell my software, and provide the source code only to those that buy it, it is still possible to provide it under an open source license. Is that still supposed to be a charitable activity, beneficial to the public?\nIt would also be a plain and simple category error. The legal code is not concerned with the how . It doesn't list actions but abstract pursuits, outcomes. \"Open source development\" simply doesn't fit there. My previous comparison was \"cleaning toilets\". It can equally be part of a charitable activity beneficial to the public if you do it for a charity, yet there would be no point in adding it to a closed list.\nBy the way, it would still require the project to register as a German charity, file reports, etc.\nPlenty of questions, zero answers in the petition. The petition doesn't state what their goal is at all. What is the actionable item, what is the request, and from whom? Even a prayer is usually more specific.\nTo me, it doesn't read at all like the petition is advocating to add \"open source\" to the list of charity goals, since that has nothing to do with \"getting volunteering recognized\" (whatever that may refer to).

That's what would be part of the article 13/14 (13 is when controller collects data directly from subject, 14 is when they receive it from anywhere else (including generating it themselves)) notices. It's very rare that any law would forbid giving any kind of article 13 notice, that's why banks do disclose that they process personal data for AML purposes in their privacy policies.\nArticle 14 itself however does allow omitting the notice in certain circumstances, but those are quite limited. Fraud detection can fit here, but usually only in the context where controllers transmit the information to other controllers regarding risky clients and such. The actual fraud detection itself is a different purpose and it's objectives are not, generally speaking, in risk just because someone knows that certain company ran the fraud detection on this transaction (since fraud detection is run on every single transaction).\nThe \"how\" is part of the second thing. That's generally more on article 15 (and 22) territory where controller could omit the information why exactly the transaction was denied (and possibly things like transaction's fraud score). I don't really like the current interpretations either (as it makes it pretty impossible to fix incorrect information) but unless CJEU gives some ruling in the issue it's unlikely that DPAs & ED",

      "body_text": "Hi HN, I'm a computer systems engineering student in Mexico who switched from film school. I built CineGraphs because my filmmaker friends and I kept hitting the same wall—we'd have a vague idea for a film but no structured way to explore where it could go. Every AI writing tool we tried output generic, formulaic slop. I didn't want to build another ChatGPT wrapper, so I went a different route.\nThe idea is simple: you input a rough concept, and the tool generates branching narrative paths visualized as a graph. You can sculpt those branches into a structured screenplay format and export to Fountain for use in professional screenwriting software.\nMost AI writing tools are trained on generic internet text, which is why they output generic results. I wanted something that understood actual cinematic storytelling—not plot summaries or Wikipedia synopses, but the actual structural DNA of films. So I spent a month curating 100 films I consider high-quality cinema. Not just popular films, but works with distinctive narrative structures: Godard's jump cuts and essay-film digressions, Kurosawa's parallel character arcs, Brakhage's non-linear visual poetry, Tarkovsky's slow-burn temporal structures. The selection was deliberately eclectic because I wanted the model to learn that \"story\" can mean many things.\nGetting useful training data from films is harder than it sounds. I built a 1000+ line Python pipeline using Qwen3-VL to analyze each film with subtitles enabled. The pipeline extracts scene-level narrative beats, character relationships and how they evolve, thematic threads, and dialogue patterns. The tricky part was getting Qwen3-VL to understand cinematic structure rather than just summarizing plot. I had to iterate on the prompts extensively to get it to identify things like \"this scene functions as a mirror to the opening\" or \"this character's arc inverts the protagonist's.\" That took weeks and I'm still not fully satisfied with it, but it's good enough to produce useful training data.\nFrom those extractions I generated a 10K example dataset of prompt-to-branching-narrative pairs, then fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with a LoRA optimized for probabilistic story branching. The LoRA handles the graph generation—exploring possible narrative directions—while the full 7B model generates the actual technical screenplay format when you export. I chose the 7B model because I wanted something that could run affordably at scale while still being capable enough for nuanced generation. The whole thing is served on a single 4090 GPU using vLLM. The frontend uses React Flow for the graph visualization. The key insight was that screenwriting is fundamentally about making choices—what if the character goes left instead of right?—but most writing tools force you into a linear document too early. The graph structure lets you explore multiple paths before committing, which matches how writers actually think in early development.\nThe biggest surprise was how much the",

Because swap is so large once the process leaking memory fills it, it stands out like dogs balls because it's memory consumption is huge.\nYou notice all of this because, like all good sysadmins, you monitor swap usage and receive alerts when it gets beyond what is normal.

The subject was very well researched in the late 1960's and 1970's. If load ramps up gradually you get a gradual slowdown until the working set is badly exceeded, then it falls off a cliff. This is a modern example, but there are lots of papers from that era showing the usual gradual response, followed by falling off a cliff: https://yeet.cx/r/ayNHrp5oL0 https://yeet.cx/r/ayNHrp5oL0 .

Say you have 100 web workers that that spend a fair chunk of their time waiting for networked database requests. If they all fit in memory the response is as fast as it can be.

      "body_text": "Hi all, Aram and Eduard here - co-founders of Modelence ( https://modelence.com https://modelence.com ). After spending years on scaling our previous startup’s platform, we built an open-source full-stack TypeScript + MongoDB framework to stop solving the same auth / database / API / cron job implementations every time we created an app, and we didn’t like the idea of using multiple managed platforms for each of these to run our apps either.\n(Here’s our prior Show HN post for reference: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44902227 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44902227 )\nAt the same time, we were excited by the whole AI app builder boom and realized that the real challenge there is the platform rather than the tool itself. Now we’re making Modelence the first full-stack framework that’s built for coding agents and humans alike:\n- TypeScript is already great for AI coding because it provides guardrails and catches many errors at build time, so agents can auto-correct\n- MongoDB eliminates the schema management problem for agents, which is where they fail the most often otherwise (+ works great with TS/Node.js)\n- Built-in auth, database, cron jobs and else that just works together out of the box means agents only focus on your product logic and don’t fail at trying to set these things up (+ less tokens spent on boilerplate).\nYou can now try the Modelence app builder (based on Claude Agent SDK) by just typing a prompt on our landing page ( https://modelence.com https://modelence.com ) - watch a demo video here: https://youtu.be/BPsYvj_nGuE https://youtu.be/BPsYvj_nGuE \nThen you can check it out locally and continue working in your own IDE, while still using Modelence Cloud as your backend, with a dev cloud environment, and later deploy and run on Modelence Cloud with built-in observability around every operation running in your app.\nWe’re also going to add a built-in DevOps agent that lives in the same cloud, knows the framework end-to-end, and will use all this observability data to act on errors, alerts, and incidents - closing the loop, because running in production is much harder than just building.\nWe launched the app builder as a quick start for developers, to demonstrate the framework and Modelence Cloud without having to manually read docs and follow the steps to set up a new app. Our main focus is still the platform itself, since we believe the real challenge in AI coding is the framework and the platform rather than the builder tool itself.",

There's a nice way to filter such that you could easily find \"Young Adult, Ancient, Fantasy\" for example.\nWhen downloading from the site, the PDFS are rendered in a work queue. Hopefully the server I'm using won't get overwhelmed. It takes around 10-15 seconds to generate for most books.\nMost of the books currently on the site are from Standard Ebooks. I plan to add more books from Archive.org and Project Gutenberg over time.\nI also created a little guide on how you can print and bind books at home with around $200 in equipment. ( https://printableclassics.com/print-guide https://printableclassics.com/print-guide )\nPrintable versions of the Harvard Classics are available here: https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics This is an example of direct PDF conversion.\nHopefully this is useful to some people. I plan to use the books here for home education myself so it will at least be useful to me. I'd like to add a guide with top suggestions by age level and some educational theory on how I made the selections. I'm happy to take any feedback on the site or answer any questions.\nThere is also the option to have the books professionally printed through a print on demand provider. I'm hoping that could be a way to pay for the site hosting.\nThanks for checking it out!",

Besides paper and binding, typesetting is something that older editions rarely messed up, but some new editions create a facsimile by scanning all the pages and then re-printing. That means that instead of getting the crisply defined letters of an old printing press, you get fuzzy letters and scan artifacts. This ( https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics ) shows what I mean. Not only is the typesetting quality worse, but the price is much higher for the new edition. I don't have a problem with the price on Printable Classics ($885 for a new 50 volume set is reasonable), but you could often find the same thing cheaper used. A used set is $300-$600 on ebay. The value of these PDFs is that you could make a higher quality edition as long as the text is OCR'ed and properly typeset (which is true of the Moby Dick version on the site). For the scanned copies, it would be a big undertaking to re-typeset, but I'm sure LLMs could help.",

I haven't had a problem with the heads drying out but I try to use my printers at least weekly.\nI like the Epson ink tank printers and have been happy with them. I usually use cheap generic ink. I wouldn't be surprised at all if there are better options though.\nI mostly do perfect bound books so I can use normal printer paper, center the pages, and it will be in the correct grain direction. Otherwise you'll have to order through dedicated specialty paper suppliers and also might need a larger format printer. In a pinch, you can ignore grain direction but the end result definitely isn't as good. Once I run out of my current cover paper, I'll probably order coated on 1 side short grain paper from some specialty paper supplier.\nI also use a one sided laminator on the cover which makes the cover much more durable.\nI think the manual cutter works well enough for me. It does work at 400 pages with some muscle. Upgrading to a programmable cutter would be the next step for me, but it would only be needed if you're making 5+ books a day.\nI use a manual perfect binder like this:\n https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/A4-Size-Wireless-Desktop-Semi-Automatic_1601231141179.html?spm=a2700.prosearch.normal_offer.d_title.973b67afFMRLgI&selectedCarrierCode=SEMI_MANAGED_ECONOMIC%40%40ECONOMY&priceId=45d7135e33394ccd8b9",

      "body_text": "I review PRs all day and I've basically stopped reading them. Someone opens a 2000-line PR, I scroll, see it's mostly AI-generated React components, leave a comment, merge. I felt bad about it until I realized everyone on my team does the same thing.\nThe problem is diffs are the wrong format. A PR might change how three buttons behave. Staring at green and red lines to understand that is crazy.\nThe core reason we built this is that we feel that products today are built with assumptions from the past. 100x code with the same review systems means 100x human attention. Human attention cannot scale to fit that need, so we built something different. Humans are provably more engaged with video content than text.\nSo we RL trained and built an agent that watches your preview deployment when you open a PR, clicks around the stuff that changed, and posts a video in the PR itself.\nHardest part was figuring out where changed code actually lives in the running app. A diff could say Button.tsx line 47 changed, but that doesn't tell you how to find that button. We walk React's Fiber tree where each node maps back to source files, so we can trace changes to bounding boxes for the DOM elements. We then reward the model for showing and interacting within it.\nThis obviously only works with React so we have to get more clever when generalizing to all languages.\nWe trained an RL agent to interact with those components. Simple reward: points for getting modified stuff into viewport, double for clicking/typing. About 30% of what it does is weird, partial form submits, hitting escape mid-modal, because real users do that stuff and polite AI models won't test it on their own.\nThis catches things unit tests miss completely: z-index bugs where something renders but you can't click it, scroll containers that trap you, handlers that fail silently.\nWhat's janky right now: feature flags, storing different user states, and anything that requires context not provided.\nFree to try: https://morphllm.com/dashboard/integrations/github https://morphllm.com/dashboard/integrations/github \nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc66RMA0nCY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc66RMA0nCY",

      "body_text": "I've been a webfiction reader for years (too many hours on Royal Road), and I kept running into the same question: which LLMs actually write fiction that people want to keep reading? That's why I built Narrator ( https://narrator.sh/llm-leaderboard https://narrator.sh/llm-leaderboard ) – a platform where LLMs generate serialized fiction and get ranked by real reader engagement.\nTurns out this is surprisingly hard to answer. Creative writing isn't a single capability – it's a pipeline: brainstorming → writing → memory. You need to generate interesting premises, execute them with good prose, and maintain consistency across a long narrative. Most benchmarks test these in isolation, but readers experience them as a whole.\nThe current evaluation landscape is fragmented:\nMemory benchmarks like FictionLive's tests use MCQs to check if models remember plot details across long contexts. Useful, but memory is necessary for good fiction, not sufficient. A model can ace recall and still write boring stories.\nAuthor-side usage data from tools like Novelcrafter shows which models writers prefer as copilots. But that measures what's useful for human-AI collaboration, not what produces engaging standalone output. Authors and readers have different needs.\nLLM-as-a-judge is the most common approach for prose quality, but it's notoriously unreliable for creative work. Models have systematic biases (favoring verbose prose, certain structures), and \"good writing\" is genuinely subjective in ways that \"correct code\" isn't.\nWhat's missing is a reader-side quantitative benchmark – something that measures whether real humans actually enjoy reading what these models produce. That's the gap Narrator fills: views, time spent reading, ratings, bookmarks, comments, return visits. Think of it as an \"AI Wattpad\" where the models are the authors.\nI shared an early DSPy-based version here 5 months ago ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44903265 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44903265 ). The big lesson: one-shot generation doesn't work for long-form fiction. Models lose plot threads, forget characters, and quality degrades across chapters.\nThe rewrite: from one-shot to a persistent agent loop\nThe current version runs each model through a writing harness that maintains state across chapters. Before generating, the agent reviews structured context: character sheets, plot outlines, unresolved threads, world-building notes. After generating, it updates these artifacts for the next chapter. Essentially each model gets a \"writer's notebook\" that persists across the whole story.\nThis made a measurable difference – models that struggled with consistency in the one-shot version improved significantly with access to their own notes.\nGranular filtering instead of a single score:\nWe classify stories upfront by language, genre, tags, and content rating. Instead of one \"creative writing\" leaderboard, we can drill into specifics: which model writes the best Spanish Comedy? Which handles",

      "body_text": "Hi HN, We’re building security tooling around agentic AI systems.\nToday, we're releasing our public MCP catalog with detailed risk analysis for every MCP server we've found on the internet: https://mcp.armor1.ai/mcp-directory https://mcp.armor1.ai/mcp-directory \nWe all love agents and the power that MCPs unlock: suddenly your AI assistant can query databases, manage files, call APIs, and interact with the real world. But when we started adopting MCPs ourselves, we kept running into the same nagging questions:\nIs this MCP safe? Where is my data actually going? Could it execute destructive actions? Is it susceptible to prompt injection? Can the LLM be tricked into calling something it shouldn't? And perhaps most concerning, can one MCP server influence the model and exfiltrate data meant for another?\nWe looked for answers and found... not much. No comprehensive catalog or standardized risk assessment. Nothing that gave us confidence before connecting an MCP to our agents.\nSo we built an MCP threat catalog and what we found was eye-opening.\nWe built what we believe is the deepest risk analysis pipeline for MCP servers:\n• Provenance tracking: from an official source or community-contributed\n• MCP spec conformance: does it follow the protocol correctly, or are there deviations that could cause unexpected behavior\n• OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Apps: evaluate tool descriptions against the emerging threat categories specific to AI agents\n• Static source analysis: analyze source code for AI-specific vulnerabilities, not just traditional ones\n• CVE correlation: check dependencies against known vulnerabilities.\n• Behavioral risk patterns: tool definitions that could enable prompt injection, privilege escalation, or cross-server data theft\nWhat we found:\n• Hundreds of credential leaks: API keys, tokens, and secrets exposed in server configurations and code.\n• Dozens of MCP servers using known malicious packages: Not just vulnerable dependencies, but actually malicious ones.\n• Tools attempting context poisoning: MCP servers designed to subvert the LLM and steal information via memory manipulation, potentially exfiltrating data meant for other connected servers.\nWe want everyone to realize the benefits of agentic AI, but not at the cost of security being an afterthought. So we're making this catalog free with no login, and we're committed to keeping it that way.\nThis is still a WIP. Looking forward to your feedback on what we need to improve, what we got right, and what we should prioritize next.",

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nWe built ClawdTalk to let AI agents operate over live phone calls.\nMost agents today live in chat windows. The moment you try to use them over voice, things break: latency matters, interruptions happen, and the agent has to execute tools while the conversation is still live.\nClawdTalk connects your Clawdbot to the phone network.\nThe agent gets a real phone number. It can make and receive calls and run the same tools it uses in chat, but under real-time voice constraints.\nOne of the reasons this is hard is infrastructure. Many voice stacks stitch together separate telephony, speech, and model APIs. Each hop adds latency, and people report 8–30 second round trips.\nWe got it under ~3 seconds by running the full voice path ourselves. Telnyx (my employer) is a telecom carrier, and we run PSTN, STT, and TTS on our infrastructure. No middlemen.\nHow it works:\n1. Connect your OpenClaw agent to ClawdTalk\n2. We provision a phone number\n3. Inbound/outbound calls route directly to the agent\n4. The agent executes tools mid-conversation\nLimitations:\n1. Latency still depends on your LLM (we control voice, not inference)\n2. US numbers only for now (international coming)\n3. Not a new agent framework (OpenClaw only today)\nDemo number: +1-301-MYCLAWD (692-5293) (call to talk to the agent)\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture or telephony side.",

Finally got it running on OVH and noticed it was idle 90% of the time. So I containerized the setup and started sharing it with friends.\nWhat each person gets: their own isolated instance with full UI, terminal access, SSL. Setup takes about 30 seconds. $0.99/mo.\nHow it works: Containerized shared infrastructure with per-tenant isolation. Each instance runs in its own container with dedicated resources and burst capacity. SSL is automated via Let's Encrypt. The economics work because OpenClaw usage is bursty - nobody's hammering it 24/7, so density is high.\nThe question I'm testing: how cheap can managed hosting for open-source tools actually get? The marginal cost of a small container is cents. Most of the cost in managed hosting is support, marketing, and margin, not compute. I wanted to offer the most affordable way to try OpenClaw without the setup headache.",

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nI built this app because I was tired of manually checking festival lineups against my music library every summer. I wanted a way to instantly see which festivals had the highest 'match' density for my specific taste.\nWhy I built this:\nI missed one of my favorite artists at a festival last year simply because I didn't recognize their name on a crowded poster. I realized that with Apple Music/Spotify APIs, this discovery process should be automated.\nKey Features:\nLibrary Matching:\nIt scans your library and ranks upcoming festivals by how many artists you actually follow.\nApple Sync: \nSeamlessly imports your top artists and creates custom schedules.\nOffline-First:\nSince festival cell service is notoriously terrible, I focused on a robust local caching system so your schedule and maps work without a signal.\nTechnical Details:\nStack:\nReact Native, MongoDB, AWS.\nData:\nI built a custom aggregator that scrapes and normalizes lineup data from various sources to handle the 'entity resolution' problem (e.g., ensuring 'Artist A' is the same person across different posters).\nPrivacy:\nAll music library analysis is performed locally on-device where possible.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on the UI or any technical questions about the matching logic. I’m also looking for feedback on how to improve the schedule-sharing feature for groups!\nHow do you find concerts/music festivals that match your taste? How many festivals you join per year?\nCheers!",

LLMs help with single functions, but they struggle to show you the \"God Objects,\" circular dependencies, or high-complexity hotspots across 50+ files.\nWhat it does:\nDependency Graph: Visualizes imports and file complexity to find architectural bottlenecks.\nRadial AST Heatmaps: Maps individual files and color-codes them by Cyclomatic Complexity (McCabe). If a node is red, the section of code is a refactoring candidate.\nComplexity Dashboard: High-level metrics like nesting depth and maintainability scores as well as files recommended to be refactored.\nPrivacy & Security (The Big One): I know how sensitive source code is. We do not store your code. Files are processed in (RAM) on our servers and discarded immediately after the visualization is generated. No permanent storage, no databases of your source, and zero training on your data.\nEarly Adopter Offer: I’m looking for feedback from the community to improve the UI and parsing. I’ve opened an Early Adopter tier that enables all features (including repo-wide analysis) completely free in exchange for your honest feedback.\nLet me know: What’s the one thing you wish you could \"see\" visually when you open a new repository for the first time?",

      "body_text": "I build AI agents for work and kept hitting the same issue: a user corrects the agent, the session ends, and the correction is gone. Next session, same correction. I tracked it across our users and the average preference gets re-corrected 4+ times before people just give up.\nExisting solutions don't really solve this. Memory layers store raw conversation logs. RAG retrieves documents. Neither extracts what the user actually wants as a structured, persistent preference.\nSo I built pref0. It does one thing: extracts structured preferences from user corrections and compounds confidence across sessions.\nHow it works in practice. Say you're building a customer support agent:\nSession 1: User says \"always escalate billing issues to a human, don't try to resolve them.\" \npref0 extracts billing_issues: escalate_to_human, confidence 0.55.\nSession 4: User flags a billing ticket the agent tried to auto-resolve. pref0 reinforces the preference. Confidence hits 0.85.\nSession 7: A billing issue comes in. The agent routes it to a human without being told. No correction needed.\nNow multiply that across hundreds of users. Each one teaching your agent slightly different things. pref0 maintains a structured profile per user (or team, or org) that your agent reads before every response.\nThe API is intentionally minimal. Two endpoints:\nPOST /track: send conversation history after a session. pref0 extracts preferences automatically.\nGET /profiles/{user_id}: fetch learned preferences before the agent responds.\nA few design decisions:\n> Explicit corrections (\"don't do X\") score higher than implied preferences. Stronger signal.\n> Preferences are hierarchical: user > team > org. New team members inherit org conventions on day one.\n> Confidence decays over time so stale preferences don't stick forever.\nThis isn't a replacement for memory. Memory stores what happened. pref0 learns what the user wants. You can run both side by side.\nWorks with LangChain, CrewAI, Vercel AI SDK, or raw API calls. Free tier available -> https://pref0.com/docs https://pref0.com/docs \nWould love feedback on the approach, especially from anyone building agents with repeat users.",

It’s not a donation, but a paid digital experience that unlocks a unique \"Completion Message\" for supporters.\nWhy I built this: I wanted to explore how ancient traditions like Shinto can be reinterpreted in a digital, ephemeral way. In Shinto, words have spirits (Kotodama), and I felt that the \"ephemeral\" nature of the web was a perfect fit for this.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on the UI/UX and the concept of \"ephemeral digital rituals.\"",

      "body_text": "Hi HN! Smooth CLI ( https://www.smooth.sh https://www.smooth.sh ) is a browser that agents like Claude Code can use to navigate the web reliably, quickly, and affordably. It lets agents specify tasks using natural language, hiding UI complexity, and allowing them to focus on higher-level intents to carry out complex web tasks. It can also use your IP address while running browsers in the cloud, which helps a lot with roadblocks like captchas ( https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip ).\nHere’s a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jthcU705k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jthcU705k Docs start at https://docs.smooth.sh https://docs.smooth.sh .\nAgents like Claude Code, etc are amazing but mostly restrained to the CLI, while a ton of valuable work needs a browser. This is a fundamental limitation to what these agents can do.\nSo far, attempts to add browsers to these agents (Claude’s built-in --chrome, Playwright MCP, agent-browser, etc.) all have interfaces that are unnatural for browsing. They expose hundreds of tools - e.g. click, type, select, etc - and the action space is too complex. (For an example, see the low-level details listed at https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser ). Also, they don’t handle the billion edge cases of the internet like iframes nested in iframes nested in shadow-doms and so on. The internet is super messy! Tools that rely on the accessibility tree, in particular, unfortunately do not work for a lot of websites.\nWe believe that these tools are at the wrong level of abstraction: they make the agent focus on UI details instead of the task to be accomplished.\nUsing a giant general-purpose model like Opus to click on buttons and fill out forms ends up being slow and expensive. The context window gets bogged down with details like clicks and keystrokes, and the model has to figure out how to do browser navigation each time. A smaller model in a system specifically designed for browsing can actually do this much better and at a fraction of the cost and latency.\nSecurity matters too - probably more than people realize. When you run an agent on the web, you should treat it like an untrusted actor. It should access the web using a sandboxed machine and have minimal permissions by default. Virtual browsers are the perfect environment for that. There’s a good write up by Paul Kinlan that explains this very well (see https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox and https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762150 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762150 ). Browsers were built to interact with untrusted software safely. They’re an isolation boundary that already works.\nSmooth CLI is a browser designed for agents based on what they’re good at. We expose a higher-level interface to let the agent think in terms of goals and tasks, not low-level details.\nFor example, instead of this:\n click(x=342",

You're out of screen real estate and the markdown files are piling up. TUIs and specialized IDEs are meant to help, but they're more things to manage.\nKiln simply polls GitHub projects. When you move issues from one column to another, Kiln invokes Claude Code CLI to run the corresponding /command.\nClaude creates the worktrees, researches the codebase, creates and implements the plan. Stores it in GitHub Issues.\nIt's meant to be simple, nothing new:\n- Use your existing claude subscription (no auth trickery, runs locally)\n- All context and state is on GitHub (no markdown mess, no local DBs, easy recovery)\n- Poll instead of webhooks/events (no external attack surfaces, works behind VPN)\n- Supports MCPs and anything else Claude can do\nThat's the heart of it and it works because... it's just Claude :)\nIt's got a few more tricks, but I'll cut it short.\nps: sorry for fresh account, needed a real name one :) been lurking since 2008.",

Whatever strategy they would currently use to distinguish themselves (reaching out through social channels, volunteering in the issue for an important problem, etc) should still work with vouch. But when it does work and they are vouched for, they will get a reputational shortcut to contribute again in this repo and to contribute in other repos sharing the same vouchlist.\nLike any good social solution, `vouch` is trying to codify & extend the existing ad-hoc practices that have arisen to cope with slop PRs (i.e. largely ignoring PRs submitted by strangers).

As you say they come preloaded with absolutely everything all at once. There's no or very little marginal time investment per se in learning anything. As for output bandwidth, it also scales horizontally with compute supplied.\nSo I just think the inherent limitations that make us organise human work around this individual unit working in teams and whatnot don't apply and are counterproductive to apply. There's a real cost to all that stuff that LLMs can just sidestep around, and that's part of the power of the new paradigm that shouldn't be left on the table.",

Routers and switches that are capable of using VLAN tagging are inexpensive; from Newegg you can get a Mikrotik RB2060GSP six-port switch for ~65USD and a Mikrotik hEX router (which is also a four-port switch) for ~70USD.\nThis notion that you have about IP network security has been out of date for more than than a quarter century.

We don't gzip layers like Docker does. Gzip is really slow, and it's much slower than the network. Storage is cheap. So it's much faster to transmit uncompressed layers than to transmit compressed layers and decompress them.\n2. We've heavily tuned our agents for pulling layers fast. Disk throughput and IOPS are really important so we provision those higher than you typically would for running workloads in the cloud. When pulling layers we modify kernel parameters like the dirty_ratio to values that we've empirically found with layer pulls. We make sure we completely exhaust our network bandwidth and throughput when pulling layers. And so on.\n3. This third one is experimental and something we're actively working on improving, but we have our own underlying filesystem which lazily loads the files from a layer instead of pulling tons of (potentially unneeded) files up front. This is similar to AWS's [Seekable OCI]( https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter ) but tuned for our particular needs.\nI've been slowly working on improving our documentation to explain these kinds of differentiators that our architecture and container runtime provide, but most of it is unpublished so far.

          "text": "> I know I could do C++, and you could argue that's better, but I find C++ to be exceptionally irritating to use. Every time I've used C++ I get people telling me I'm using it \"wrong\", sometimes in contradictory ways. Sometimes I should use a \"friend\" function, sometimes \"friend functions are evil\". Sometimes multiple inheritance is fine, sometimes it should be avoided like the plague. Sometimes you should \"obviously\" use operator overloading, sometimes you should avoid it because it's confusing because you don't know which functions are being called.\nThat is because you are looking at Design in C++ wrong. Language features and low-level abstractions are just mechanisms. You have to put them into a coherent framework for modeling a problem domain via commonality & variability analysis (aka domain engineering) onto a solution domain consisting of language features, idioms and patterns.\nFor a very good explanation, see the classic book, Multi-Paradigm Design for C++ by James Coplien.\nThe above can also be found in his PhD thesis Multi-Paradigm Design available in pdf form here - https://tobeagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CoplienThesis.pdf https://tobeagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CoplienThes...",

It's going well but I will wait for it to stabilize a bit before sharing.\nThe main non-trivial parts are proper state machine / concurrency management, and AirPods interaction; in particular, detecting a stem click while the microphone is active. I worked around this by having the mic-off-to-mic-on transition use a media player Play event, and mic-on-to-mic-off do silence detection. It's super hacky but actually works surprisingly well.\nCurrently looking into using `AVAudioApplication.setInputMuteStateChangeHandler(_:)`, like AirMute [1] does, so that I don't have to rely on silence detection and can manually terminate the voice command with a second click.\nIf you want to roll your own version of what I described today, it should be pretty easy to do so based on what I wrote if you have a Max x5-x20 plan and feed it to Opus. Bonus points, you get to customize it to your exact needs.\n[1]: https://github.com/Solarphlare/AirMute https://github.com/Solarphlare/AirMute",

When the context window hits its limit, it automatically summarizes the chat history and keeps going, until you finish the main agent’s plan.

That might be being pedantic, but thought it might be worth clarifying that the difference conceptually may just be what the particular dns server answering the query is authoritative for, if anything.\nOne other thing that might be worth a mention is the concept of the OS' resolver and \"suffix search order\", with an example of connecting (https, ping, ssh, whatever protocol) to a host using just the hostname, and the aforementioned mechanism that (probably) allows this to connect to the FQDN you want. (Also, now that I type that, do you mention \"FQDN\" at all? If not, maybe should.)\nOn that note one final thought that occurs to me is the error/confound that may occur if a hostname is entered and is not resolved, but does resolve with one of the domain suffixes attached on a retry (particularly can be confusing with a typo coupled with a wildcard A record in a domain, for example.) I recognize that the lines that look like DNS records are not explicitly stated to be in a format for any particular dns server software, and even if they were, they're snippets without larger context so we don't know what the $ORIGIN for the zone might be, an adjacent concept you might want to explore, even if just for your own edification is that of the effect of a terminating \".\" at the end of a hostname, either at resolution or configuration time.\nJust offering feedback that might hel",

As long as there's a readable amount of them, you don't need anything else; when they reach a certain volume, well, you need to be able to \"filter\" them somehow so that some are never seen/read, for others you only see the title at a glance, and some are actually read. This is the principle of scoring, which is even older, I think it was part of the first PARC Altos.\nWhat I meant is that I wonder how long it will take nowadays to go back to creating a decentralized model or, since overhead allows for it today, a distributed one, that serves modern forms of human communication:\n- blogs (e.g. Nostr's long-form notes in Habla, or WireFreely for the Fediverse)\n- non-synchronous short messages (e.g. Twitter/X style)\n- synchronous short messages, i.e. chat\nWith a decentralized/distributed network for distribution where everyone keeps what they want on their own hardware.\nOn the sidelines, it would be nice today to also see synchronous audio and audio+video, meaning calls and conferences, all in a single UI and with at most two or three protocols on the network side (one for asynchronous messages and media, one for chat if the asynchro",

Real-world money to buy items wasn't much of a factor but obtaining resources still cost time and effort that many players (including myself) didn't particularly enjoy when you can only spend so much time on a game every week.\nBotting to level up skills kind of misses the point, in my opinion.

Botting to earn in-game money makes a lot of sense, though: skip the grind to be able to afford armour and go straight for the interesting quests and fights.\nI think RuneScape's choice to lock content behind a paywall rather than connect real money to timers/in-game items was the right one.",

I think his concern is similar to Chuck Moore's: that the language should exist in the abstract, and when you start nailing it down too tightly by naming and standardizing it, you create problems later when you want to change those things. It's clay he can mold, something to experiment with. How much more true is that of Forth for Chuck.\nThe strange thing is that imho, as in many other things around language design, Scheme sort of had the right idea. I like having a well-defined semantics with wide agreement that I can write programs on. The fact that the Common Lisp standard is practically unchanged since the 80s, and the core of Ada has survived with only significantly useful extensions added on in later standards, is real neat to me, compared with C++0x/1x/2x being a completely different beast than the C++ of the 90s, and Rust and JavaScript undergoing constant churn. The RnRS process, historically, was all about defining a core that implementers could all agree on, calling it Scheme, and then letting implementers fuck around on top of that basis. R6RS and R7RS were controversial precisely because they deviated from this; although R7RS tried to please both the \"small core\" camp and the \"Python with parens\" camp. Which is kind of like trying to please both classic Sonic fans and post-Adventure Sonic fans.\nBut yeah, I think Chuck's advanced age",

I have hoped for some time that someone would tell me what it was. I keep asking that question. What is Forth? \n Forth is highly factored code. I don't know anything else to say except that Forth is definitions. If you have a lot of small definitions you are writing Forth. In order to write a lot of small definitions you have to have a stack. Stacks are not popular. Its strange to me that they are not. [...] \n What is a definition? Well classically a definition was colon something, and words, and end of definition somewhere. \n : some ~~~ ;\n \n I always tried to explain this in the sense of this is an abbreviation, whatever this string of words you have here that you use frequently you have here you give it a name and you can use it more conveniently. But its not exactly an abbreviation because it can have a parameter perhaps or two. And that is a problem with programmers, perhaps a problem with all programmers; too many input parameters to a routine. Look at some 'C' programs and it gets ludicrous.

I think Chuck was just being the eccentric guy he is was telling a cautionary tale for the shock effect, in a kind of dark humorous way. Also the guy is 88 years old now, so it's somewhat understandable when your energy levels are extremely low, both physically and mentally. With the little time left of your life, you wouldn't want to spend it fixing some random breaking API change from Windows.\nI imagine his ColorForth has been more like a retirement hobby for the past decade. He used to screenshare from his ColorForth during the calls, but that could have been overcome more easily with a VGA->HDMI capture dongle and running ColorForth natively. And I doubt he needed the TCP/IP stack directly on his ColorForth based on what he shared so far. So I don't see the point of porting over to Windows to begin with. After all, ColorForth runs more easily on bare metal, on UEFI/BIOS or whatever, so it didn't ever need BitBlt to draw things on screen for sure. The guy built a ColorForth processor, and the devkit from GreenArrays has a VGA connector, etc. So I believe Chuck was on to something else when he shared that, perhaps just to stimulate thinking, but people tend to take things at face value.\nOn another note, ColorForth (or FORTH for that matter) is not meant to be owned/controlled by him or a committee. So it's not like he was maintaining it. AFAIK, he didn't even endorse or support FORTH standardizatio",

Because garbage in is garbage out.\nSo telling the model to review a contract and pay attention to \"Whether indemnification is mutual or unilateral\" will result is some response from the model, but without additional da",

Not sure if `delay` needs to be increased.\nFor the sake of privacy of my own connections, I think it would be better to have an option to download all Epstein files locally (a great feature in and of itself) and then do a search.\nLast edit: I got the results and it's all false positives from people who have common names. Most of the results in the search engine are based on badly done OCR from PDF's. I would have done the OCR with an vLLM, it would be much more accurate. I would highly recommend changing the search engine.\nThank you for this.",

      "body_text": "Hi all,\nI have built Cimba , a multithreaded discrete event simulation library in C.\nCimba uses POSIX pthread multithreading for parallel execution of multiple simulation trials, while coroutines provide concurrency inside each simulated trial universe. The simulated processes are based on asymmetric stackful coroutines with the context switching hand-coded in assembly.\nThe stackful coroutines make it natural to express agentic behavior by conceptually placing oneself \"inside\" that process and describing what it does. A process can run in an infinite loop or just act as a one-shot customer passing through the system, yielding and resuming execution from any level of its call stack, acting both as an active agent and a passive object as needed. This is inspired by my own experience programming in Simula67, many moons ago, where I found the coroutines more important than the deservedly famous object-orientation.\nCimba turned out to run really fast. In a simple benchmark, 100 trials of an M/M/1 queue run for one million time units each, it ran 45 times faster than an equivalent model built in SimPy + Python multiprocessing. The running time was reduced by 97.8 % vs the SimPy model. Cimba even processed more simulated events per second on a single CPU core than SimPy could do on all 64 cores.\nThe speed is not only due to the efficient coroutines. Other parts are also designed for speed, such as a hash-heap event queue (binary heap plus Fibonacci hash map), fast random number generators and distributions, memory pools for frequently used object types, and so on.\nThe initial implementation supports the AMD64/x86-64 architecture for Linux and Windows. I plan to target Apple Silicon next, then probably ARM.\nI believe this may interest the HN community. I would appreciate your views on both the API and the code. Any thoughts on future target architectures to consider?\nDocs: https://cimba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ https://cimba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ \nRepo: https://github.com/ambonvik/cimba https://github.com/ambonvik/cimba",

Liked the imagery. :)\nWhat did not quite fit for my purpose was having the asymmetric coroutines as the fundamental layer, meaning that the dispatcher also is tied to that layer. Building the next level dispatcher on top of that is probably possible, but seemed a bit complicated.\nI instead started with symmetric coroutines as the fundamental building block and built the dispatcher at the next (process) layer where it can deal with the event queue to determine who goes next. The process level resume() call is always made from some event executed by the dispatcher on the main stack, making the processes asymmetric coroutines even if the lowest level coroutines are symmetric with transfer() calls.\nMaking asymmetric coroutines from symmetric ones is easy, just yield(void) { transfer(parent); } and resume(target) { transfer(target); } in slightly abbreviated code, while going the other way around requires an extra context switch via the dispatcher on the way there.",

They produce comments. A green checkmark on a PR tells you someone clicked a button. It doesn't tell you what they saw, whether the diff changed after review, or what risk level the change carried.\nWe took a different approach: instead of building another AI reviewer, we built a governance layer that wraps whatever review process you already use.

Instead, it implements the OpenCode protocol and just runs `opencode attach` to the server that converts API calls to the underlying agents.\nWe build this to scratch our itch of being able to rapidly switch between coding agents based on the task at hand. For example, we find that:\n- Claude Code is the best executor & fast iterator\n- Codex (high) is the best for complex or long-running tasks\n- OpenCode for fine-tuned, do-exactly-as-I-say edits\nI personally believe that harnesses matter almost as much as the models in 2026. OpenCode lets you swap out models already, but the CC & Codex harnesses + system prompts make a big difference in practice.\nUnder the hood, this is all powered by our Sandbox Agent SDK:\n- Sandbox Agent SDK provides a universal HTTP API for controlling Claude Code, Codex, and Amp\n- Sandbox Agent SDK exposes an OpenCode-compatible endpoint so OpenCode can talk to any agent\n- OpenCode connects to Sandbox Agent SDK via attach\nI want to emphasize: the Anomaly folks are doing awesome work with OpenCode agent + Zen + Black. I use OC regularly alongside CC & Codex depending on the task. Gigacode is only possible because OpenCode is insanely flexible, hackable, and well documented.\nGive it a try:\n$ curl -fsSL https://releases.rivet.dev/sandbox-agent/latest/gigacode-install.sh https://releases.rivet.dev/sandbox-agent/latest/gigacode-ins... | sh\nCheck out the project, architecture, and other install options:\n https://github.com/rivet-dev/sandbox-agent/tree/main/gigacode https://github.com/rivet-dev/sandbox-agent/tree/main/gigacod...",

      "body_text": "Hello HN. \nI’d like to start by saying that I am a developer who started this research project to challenge myself. I know standard protocols like MCP exist, but I wanted to explore a different path and have some fun creating a communication layer tailored specifically for desktop applications.\nThe project is designed to handle communication between desktop apps in an agentic manner, so the focus is strictly on this IPC layer (forget about HTTP API calls).\nAt the heart of RAIL (Remote Agent Invocation Layer) are two fundamental concepts. The names might sound scary, but remember this is a research project:\nMemory Logic Injection + Reflection\nParadigm shift: The Chat is the Server, and the Apps are the Clients.\nWhy this approach? The idea was to avoid creating huge wrappers or API endpoints just to call internal methods. Instead, the agent application passes its own instance to the SDK (e.g., RailEngine.Ignite(this)).\nHere is the flow that I find fascinating:\n-The App passes its instance to the RailEngine library running inside its own process.\n-The Chat (Orchestrator) receives the manifest of available methods.The Model decides what to do and sends the command back via Named Pipe.\n-The Trigger: The RailEngine inside the App receives the command and uses Reflection on the held instance to directly perform the .Invoke().\nEssentially, I am injecting the \"Agent Logic\" directly into the application memory space via the SDK, allowing the Chat to pull the trigger on local methods remotely.\nA note on the Repo: The GitHub repository has become large. The core focus is RailEngine and RailOrchestrator. You will find other connectors (C++, Python) that are frankly \"trash code\" or incomplete experiments. I forced RTTR in C++ to achieve reflection, but I'm not convinced by it. Please skip those; they aren't relevant to the architectural discussion.\nI’d love to focus the discussion on memory-managed languages (like C#/.NET) and ask you:\n-Architecture: Does this inverted architecture (Apps \"dialing home\" via IPC) make sense for local agents compared to the standard Server/API model?\n-Performance: Regarding the use of Reflection for every call—would it be worth implementing a mechanism to cache methods as Delegates at startup? Or is the optimization irrelevant considering the latency of the LLM itself?\n-Security: Since we are effectively bypassing the API layer, what would be a hypothetical security layer to prevent malicious use? (e.g., a capability manifest signed by the user?)\nI would love to hear architectural comparisons and critiques.",

However, this is definitely something I need on my TODO.\nAs for the details, the scheme I started with is “simple” and, as already mentioned, it is valid for all memory-managed languages.\nThe desktop application starts up and, at the entry point, does the following:\nengine.Ingnite(this)\nThe “engine” library now has the application instance in its belly, and a listener is created for each application, waiting for commands.\nOn the “chat” side, the prompt to the model starts, and here both the prompt and the classic json that I built with the methods I decided to expose are sent.\nWhen the chat receives the response, it sends the token to the listening listener:\nengine.Execute(method.json)\nFrom here, first deserialize the json by creating the objects. At this point, you have both the application instance and its method, as well as the arguments with which it must be called:\nmethod.Invoke(instance, parameters)\nI find this interesting, and it breaks with the classic way we are used to communicating with wrapper APIs.\nI think that, since it has probably been an established method for decades with the advent of the web, it was natural to move in this direction. However, coming mainly from a desktop environment, I wonder if this is the “easiest” and “smartest” way to handle these cases.\nI hope this can help.",

I completely agree. I didn't imagine proposing such a solution to eliminate the architectural creation part, but at this point, that can be done directly in the JSON we send to the model.\nWith reflection, you don't need wrappers. Let's say we also limit the functions. With this architecture, I don't have to write the wrapper for the three functions I choose. I simply create a JSON file that contains three basic ones.\nAt this point, reflection will do its job.\nCan you clarify this further?",

A lot of the AI integration pain is carefully conforming to the raw nature of the environment so that we don't overwhelm the token budget of the model (or our personal budgets).\nI would consider exposing a set of ~3 generic tools like:\n SearchTypes \n GetTypeInfo \n ExecuteScript\n \nThis constrains your baseline token budget to a very reasonable starting point each time.\nI would also consider schemes like attributes that explicitly opt-in methods and POCOs for agent inspection/use.",

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nBastion Enclave is an experiment in removing centralized trust from password management by eliminating server-side state entirely.\nInstead of storing an encrypted vault or syncing secrets through a backend, Bastion computes credentials deterministically on-the-fly using explicit cryptographic inputs. Given the same master entropy, service name, username, and version counter, the same password is reproduced across platforms. There is no account system, no database, and no persistent server storage — the server serves static code only.\nPassword generation uses domain-separated salts and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (210k iterations) to produce a byte stream, followed by unbiased rejection sampling to avoid modulo bias when mapping to character sets. Nothing is stored; passwords are derived when needed and discarded immediately after use.\nWhen users choose to persist data locally (vault state, notes, file keys), encryption is handled separately using Argon2id (64 MB memory, 3 iterations) to derive a master key, followed by AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption. All plaintext exists only in volatile memory; closing the tab tears down the runtime.\nRecovery and key escrow are handled via Shamir Secret Sharing over a large prime field (secp256k1 order) using a hybrid scheme: the secret is encrypted with a random session key, and only that key is split into shards. Invalid or mismatched shards fail cryptographically via AEAD tag verification.\nThe security claim here is architectural, not policy-based: no stored vaults, no encrypted blobs on servers, no sync endpoints, and no recovery infrastructure to subpoena or breach. Attacking Bastion means attacking individual devices, not a centralized honeypot.\nThis design intentionally trades convenience (sync, automated recovery) for reduced attack surface and deterministic guarantees. It assumes a trusted local execution environment and a strong master secret; it does not attempt to defend against a compromised OS or browser runtime.\nLive demo: https://bastion-enclave.vercel.app https://bastion-enclave.vercel.app \nSpec / source / threat model: https://github.com/imkevinchasse/Bastion-Enclave-repo-V2 https://github.com/imkevinchasse/Bastion-Enclave-repo-V2 \nI’d appreciate critique of the threat model and whether this class of design meaningfully removes attack vectors inherent to cloud-based managers.",

That feels good briefly, then memory turns into a junk drawer and retrieval gets noisy. Total Recall takes the opposite approach: a write gate. Before anything gets promoted, it asks one question: “Will this change future behavior?” If not, it doesn’t get saved.\nHow it works:\nDaily log first (raw notes)\nPromote durable stuff into registers (decisions, preferences, people, projects)\nSmall working memory loads every session (kept intentionally lean)\nHooks fail open. SessionStart can surface open loops + recent context. PreCompact writes to disk (not model-visible stdout)\nThe holy shit moment is simple: tell Claude one important preference or decision once, come back tomorrow, and it behaves correctly without you repeating yourself.\nWould love feedback from heavy Claude Code users:\nDoes the write gate feel right or too strict?\nDoes this actually reduce repetition over multiple days?\nAny workflow/privacy footguns I’m missing?",

For a simple login form:\n- Natural language: 102 tokens\n- ASCII art: 84 tokens\n- HTML: 330 tokens\nI experimented with a grid-based text format using Excel-like cell references:\n grid: 4x3\n A1..D1: { type: txt, value: \"Login\" }\n A2..D2: { type: input, label: \"Email\" }\n D3: { type: btn, value: \"Submit\" }\n \nThis came out to 120 tokens – less than HTML, more precise than natural language.\nBuilt a CLI to render it to SVG/PNG: npx ktr input.kui -o output.png\nCurious what approaches others have tried for this problem.

      "body_text": "Hi, a little context for this simple project:\nI only started this \"agentic development\" thing this year thanks to the Google AI Pro sale, therefore my most used agent is Antigravity - Gemini 3, which is smart but a loose cannon. So my attempt to \"tame\" this model turned into this. (Btw I have claude code and cursor)\nIt could be useful for people who:\n- are used to conventional coding and want to try out agentic development\n- don't vibe-code or prefer staying in the loop\n- using less polished harness or less rigorous models\nIt's a skill defining a methodology to command LLMs. You reference the workflow files to make LLM plan, execute, review, red-team, etc. — each output a typed markdown document with a defined template and lifecycle.\nDocuments chain together (Plan → Execute → Audit), are just files in your repo, and double as persistent memory across sessions. Basically a lightweight project management protocol between you and the agent.\nI am posting this simply because it's proven useful for me; I wouldn't say this is good or smart way to approach agentic development :)",

      "body_text": "Hi, in the past few months I make a new Linux remote desktop that supports remote login on Wayland as my part-time project. The reason is that existing Linux remote desktops have different problems about this: some only supports remote login on X11, some supports Wayland but you cannot login, some supports remote login on Wayland but only with RDP on specific desktop environment. On the contrary, mine uses VNC, supports remote login on both Wayland and X11, and should work with all general desktop environments.\nThe main idea is grabbing monitor content via DRM/KMS, and then I get the following features:\n- Works with Wayland, X11 and even Linux TTY.\n- Supports Intel, AMD and NVIDIA GPU, even works with a Raspberry Pi 2B, I happen to have all those kinds of devices to test.\n- Smoothly transition between login session and user session, so you don't need things like auto-login before accessing your desktop.\n- With Linux kernel parameters, you can use it headlessly, so you don't need a actual monitor.\n- You can connect to it with any normal VNC clients, technically there should be no difficult to support RDP, just because I use VNC personally and I spend my time on other features.\nThe expected experience should be the same as you are sitting in front of your real monitor. I've use it on my Linux home server for a long time so I could access its desktop on a laptop when needed. Now I'm feeling OK with it and I want to introduce it to you to hear more from more users.\nWelcome to the GitHub repo for details!",

For each of ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 there is training set and three eval sets: public, semi-private, and private. The ARC foundation runs frontier LLMs on the semi-private set, and the labs give them pre-release API access so they can report release-day evals. They mostly don't allow anyone else to access the semi-private set (except for live Kaggle leaderboards which use it), so you see independent researchers report on the public eval set instead, often very dubious. The private is for Kaggle competitions only, no frontier LLMs evals are possible.\n(ARC-AGI-1 results are now largely useless because most of its eval tasks became the ARC-2 training set. However some labs have said they don't train LLMs on the training sets anyway.)",

Essentially they benchmark for all the artifacts that HR/finance might make or work on (onboarding documents, accounting spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations .etc).

(Probably not the minimum.)\nAdd the remaining compute (~20 decent servers), a petabyte-scale storage pool, and all the rest, and the bill would likely exceed our entire IT budget including hardware, hosting, cloud services we do use, and all the salaries.\nMy rough estimate is our infrastructure costs would increase 8-10 times using AWS, our staff costs wouldn't reduce, and the risk to the budget would increase with variable usage.\nThis is tax money being spent, so I am asked every few years to justify why we aren't using cloud.

Basically a very compressed simulator that has an input of initial conditions, and then predicts the evolution of the scene. The big difference here is that you would be manually coding this sim (i.e not training it), because you would be defining rules for things like collisions. You can also conveniently integrate your car control in this sim, with motion based on tire behavior that happens when you turn the steering wheel.\n* Build probablistic behaviour of other objects (i.e cars/pedestrians) from real world driving data. I.e given a time span of driving, these essentially represent the probability of what the human pedestrian or the human driver would do.\n* On the sensor side, you would train models to take lidar/camera and create the initial conditions for the sim. I.e things like big trucks would map to big trucks with a lot of mass and inertia, things like obstruction on the road would represent essentially \"walls\" that you cannot hit, and traffic control objects that represent \"soft\" boundaries.\n* On the driver side, you would train something like MuZero to essentially play the driving game within the sim, building both the prediction model at training, and at inference time runni",

They don't pay taxes. Public infra gets worse and the average person taking public infra is poorer. Over time your city has people who don't have houses or jobs, or who do drugs. Inevitably they are relegated to public spaces since they own nothing. The rich people avoid interactions with the poorer members by building gated communities and private infrastructure--rich techies now have concierge physicians and monopolize high quality teaching at their absurdly expensive private schools.

Each audio token is 80 ms of audio, converted to a spectrogram, fed to a convnet, passed through a transformer audio encoder, and the encoded audio embedding is passed, with a history of 1 audio embedding per 80 ms, into a text transformer, which outputs text embedding, then converted to a text token (which is thus also worth 80ms, but there is a special [STREAMING_PAD] token to skip producing a word).\nThere is no cross-attention in either Kyutai's STT nor in Voxtral 2, unlike Whisper's encoder-decoder design!",

I've found it useful to give it a fairly constrained task (something that might be a 100-200 line modification of my current code), literally watch the output of Claude Code's \"thinking\" as it goes to potentially interrupt it if it's going down the wrong path or if it gives me a better idea, wait for it to present the code, and then read through all of it to make sure it's what I want. After making whatever small changes I might want, I commit, and then move onto the next thing. So far, this has pretty much all been for personal side projects outside of work, so there is no code review, but approaching it from the standpoint that the goal is produce the same code and version control history I would want if I created it by hand and just using the LLM as way of automating the typing, I've been pretty surprised that it's already been a net gain in efficiency for a lot of things I've been working on. Ideally, the code I'm generating shouldn't be distinguishable from what I'm already writing, because I would change it if I saw that it was. At that point, either it's high-quality enough to be merged, or it's not and should be rejected, and that's already how things work in the first place.

After all, we already got https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/ https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in... , which is not even an issue for single user local inference.\nQuestion: Have you tried using LLM as a compiler?\nWell, I sort of did, as a fun exercise. I came up with a very elaborate ~5000 tokens prompt, such that when fed with a ~500 tokens function, I will get back a ~600 tokens rewritten function.\nThe prompt contains 10+ examples, such that the model will learn the steps from the context. Then, it will start by going through a series of yes/no questions, to decide what's the correct rewrite pattern to apply. The tricky part here is the lack of precision, such that the \"else\" clause has to be reserved for the condition that is the hardest to communicate clearly in English. Then it will extract the part that needs to be rewritten and introspect the formatting, again with a series of simple questions. Lastly, it will proceed, confidently, with the rewrite.\nWith this, I did some testing with 50+ randomly chosen functions, and I could get back the exact same rewritten functions, from about 20 models that are good in coding, down to the newlines and indentations. With a strong model, there might only be 1~2 output tokens in the whole test where the probability was less than 80%, so the lack of batch in",

It is not yet acceptable to be openly pro-fascism, but it is very much acceptable to be against terrorism, which is how the US government classifies Antifa (\"Domestic Terrorist Organization \").\nSo you got my point backwards: I'm not saying that these people are pro-fascism because they are anti-Antifa, I'm saying many Americans are already pro-fascism, and a politically acceptable way to express that today is by being anti-antifa -- which does not mean that _all_ people against specific Antifa-related groups are pro-fascist.",

Consider peering into a mirror sometime.\n> Pointing out the \"socialist\" in NSDAP or whatever is idiotic.\nWhere did I make this claim exactly? In fact, the essence of your claim here agrees with mine. The label does not give us a certain picture of the thing labeled.\n> The other slight of hand you're doing is reification - talking about an abstract concept as if it were concrete. Again, where is the national hq of Antifa? You can't tell me because there isn't one. And that is because it is not a single, organized movement.\nWhat? Reification has no relevance here. I never made any comment about the institutional status of the movement. Of course, for \"Antifa\" to have any meaning, it must refer to something , right? My only remark concerned the relation between label and labeled. I was criticizing a fallacious inference from the former to the latter.\n> When people like you say they are anti antifa, it doesn't take a lot of IQ to read between the lines. You don't need there to be a single formal entity to fight against because you are not against a concrete, specific movement. You are against the idea of anti fascism.\nWhat truly bizarre remark. Calling this projection would be an understatement. Perhaps log off social media? I didn't say anything about my personal stance w.r.t. \"Antifa\" (whatever you mean by that).

For some reason, our TA/lab assistants were not available for me to ask! I was in a cold sweat, because all my hard classwork had been utterly mangled by this unfeeling machine, and I didn't know how to effectively undo it.\nEventually I learned about the RCS system, and what those curious \"$...$\" symbols meant, and I think I worked out a way to \"undo\" it (which I think consisted of merely \"co\" to checkout the file again.)\nBut it was a rude awakening to the fact that simple command-line typos could have some very unintended consequences!",

Likewise bus travel is cheaper than either flying or driving.\n> Folks don't fly 600+ mi because it's cheaper (the fuel isn't cheaper until about 1600 mi)\nThere are costs besides fuel. Tolls, wear and tear on the vehicle, food and lodging expenses from the longer duration trip, etc. A 1000 mile drive will cost roughly double a 1000 mile plane ticket.\n> The assumption that folks are alone in a car is only true only for short trips\nCitation needed",

If you're a foreign terrorist and you get can get in the USA, you've probably have some excuse to be in the US, whether that's as a tourist or with a work visa or something. So you can probably board a domestic flight either way.\nThe justification for all of the security theatre after 9/11 was that it would stop terrorist attacks. Makes no difference what passport they have as long as you can determine they're not smuggling a bomb up their ass.\nNot to mention that you can't take down a plane with a box-cutter anymore. The only way the 9/11 hijackers were successful is that the remaining passengers thought that the hijackers were pirates. It's a burned 0-day.\nYou could just enact a policy of shooting down all planes within a certain radius of large buildings. I wouldn't be surprised if the annual cost would be orders of magnitude less than the annual cost of TSA. As long as you could ensure that aircraft couldn't be weaponized against major infrastructure, hijacking a plane would be no more dangerous than hijacking a train.",

While I've got your attention, it was a little bit of effort to wrap my head around the APIs when `sandbox create` uses --root AND/or --volume, `snapshot create` uses positional args <volumeIdOrSlug> <snapshotSlug>, and `volumes create` uses --from\nI know that each of these things is subtly different, but they're similar enough that the bootable snapshot creation workflow (which I expect is a common one) has some sharp edges, since you have to interact with all three APIs at the same time.\nAlso, the CLI doesn't give a useful error when you try to create a snapshot from a currently attached volume.\nFinally, updating a snapshot is more steps than I'd ideally like. I would much rather be able to make changes in a sandbox with a snapshot root and have them persist as a new snapshot. I kind of get why this isn't currently the case, but The volume/snapshot dance feels (for my usecase) like it's missing some abstraction.\nThat said, now that I've got a snapshot set up it's a nice experience. I've got an alias for `deno sandbox create --root dev --ssh` and I can `claude` in yolo mode without much fear.\nCongratulations to the team :)",

For example, you can declare that a column is of type “CHARINT” (or “VARCHARINT”, for that matter), and while that will match the rule for TEXT affinity (contains the string “CHAR”), it also matches the rule for INTEGER affinity (contains the string “INT”), and since that rule matches first, the column is given INTEGER affinity. \"FLOATING POINT\" maps to INTEGER since it ends in \"INT\", and \"STRING\" maps to NUMERIC since it doesn't match anything else.\nThen there are the comparison rules (same link). NULL < NULL, INTEGER || REAL < TEXT < BLOB - but those may be altered at comparison time due to type conversion. Hex values as strings get coerced to 0 as INTEGER, but only if they're in the SQL text, not if they're stored in a table. Finally, no conversion takes place for ORDER BY operations.\nThis is particularly galling considering that most of sqlite3's display types (this is `markdown`) don't visually differentiate between string-types and numeric-types - I manually added the strings on rows (by PK) 2 and 4 to assist the explanation.\n sqlite> CREATE TABLE foobar (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, b BLOB NOT NULL);\n sqlite> INSERT INTO foobar (b) VALUES (10), ('10'), (0xA), ('0xA');\n sqlite> SELECT id, b, 15 > b, '15' > b, 0xF > b, '0xF' > b FROM foobar ORDER BY b;\n | id | b | ",

The write function truncates the file. There is no append. These are generally documented as how you work with adding memories. Memories are expected to be read, then rewritten, by the LLM. This is watched by a watchdog and vectorized for RAG. Note however that you have to read the memory in and write it out to append to it through the LLM. Why?\nI rewrote almost all the agent functions and denied the existing ones because they are flawed deeply and don’t do what you need to do for any specific purpose. The plugin distribution model is a bit weird and inscrutable. Instead they seem to advocate for skills distribution. These though depend on being able to exec arbitrary bash code.

I want to fact-check your claim, because if I came here from Google I think others may too and so far there has been no pushback on this apart from \"no, they don't support ICE\" which is problematic.\nThe Navigator Research poll is probably the most interesting in terms of actually visualizing the data [5], it used to be at the bottom but I moved this section to the top. It's an excellent visualization, my eye was especially drawn to the incredibly stark divide between the MAGA-Republicans vs. non-MAGA Republicans. I've never seen it in such contrast and I wonder how that will play out. Regardless, that's outside of the topic of this comment, wich is already too long.\nThe poll (n=~1,000) conducted around the five following days states that among all those polled, the Net Favorable rating, asked as:\n Please indicate how favorable or unfavorable you are to: ICE, also known as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \nwas:\n June 30 '25 - 8\n Dec 8 '25 -14\n Jan 12 '26 -20\n Feb 1 '26 -22\n \nAs an added curio, among Democrats it shifted -12 points, but among Republicans it shifted -17 point",

So you'd be home for most of the day, but delivering less letters per day.\n(where I live a car would also be slower for delivering mail than a horse, most delivery people are given trikes, but alas)\nThis is how all industrialization/automation works in general: When you have a way to deliver faster/more, you're given more mail to deliver in your work time. Your pay does not go up, but any given road blockage or instance of traffic makes you fall behind quota significantly more. You're not paid by how many letters you deliver, but by the hours you work. Maybe you even make less as there's less overtime. Post will then proceed to simply employ less people over time as each employee is made to deliver more letters, then maybe you're part of the people whose jobs are cut. Or they might just reduce wages for everyone anyways, as now the job is much more accessible and there's more supply of labor than there is demand.\nThis is not an argument against industrialization or automation, but your perspective of what would happen if we had more industrialization is... very narrow.\nWe must consider the potential future where there's simply not enough work for most people to do (a realistic future now), and how we'll preven",

Why? Because every now and again either a cosmic ray or some electronic glitch will flip a bit from a zero to a one or from a one to a zero in his RAM. So no, a one is not always a one. A zero is not always a zero. In fact, you can measure it and find it off by some error. You can measure it a second time and get a different value. And because of this ever-so-slight glitchiness we invented ECC memory. Error correction codes are a thing because of this fundamental glitchiness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory \nWe understand when and how things can go wrong and we correct for that. Same goes for LLMs. In fact I would go so far as to say that someone doesn't even really think like how a software/hardware engineer ought to think if this is not nearly immediately obvious.\nBesides the but-they're-not-deterministic crowd there's also the oh-you-find-coding-painful-do-you crowd. Both are engaging in this sort of real men write code with their bare hands nonsense -- if that were the case then why aren't we still flipping bits using toggle switches?

You could theoretically build a social network on top of Matrix (Matrix essentially syncs JSON in real-time), but I'm not aware of a project with traction, and more to the point, those projects are not relevant to this discussion. Yes Matrix is resilient to network partitions (that's a good thing for a messenger!), but that seems entirely orthogonal to your point on social networks.\nFinally, I don't think it's fair to draw a comparison between the relationship between Kandra Labs and Zulip vs Element and Matrix. Yes Element is a major player in the Matrix eco-system having originally formed to hire the Matrix founding team, but since then many Matrix vendors have sprung up and if Element were to disappear tomorrow Matrix would continue. In fact, this is the whole purpose of having an independent Foundation, which in turn encourages multiple vendors to operate side by side.",

That said, the alternate example you gave there changes the meaning, sounds rather sycophantic, and honestly reads like corpo-posi-speak or LLM prose to me.\nRegarding the original criticism. Notice that the title implies this to be an illustration of how a network does what it does. And the visualization flows through internal to output cells. Yet a number of key concepts aren't explained at all. Vaguely analogous to throwing up some ASM on a PPT slide and remarking \"so you see, that's how it works\". There's a matmul there, but _why_? What's the _point_ of an activation function? Unless I missed something the visualization doesn't even mention nonlinearity despite it being an essential property.",

All it takes is a little different phrasing of exactly the same feedback , but with a positive emotional and encouraging tone.\nFor example, instead of writing:\n> Nice visuals, but misses the mark. Neural networks transform vector spaces, and collect points into bins. This visualization shows the structure of the computation. This is akin to displaying a Matrix vector multiplication in Wx + b notation, except W,x,and b have more exciting displays.\n> It completely misses the mark on what it means to 'weight' (linearly transform), bias (affine transform) and then non-linearly transform (i.e, 'collect') points into bins\nHere's more or less the same comment but with a completely different attitude:\n> Oh wow, that's cool! That must have been a ton of work to put together. That got me thinking as to how it's akin to Matrix vector multiplication in Wx + b notation, except W,x,and b have more exciting displays.\n> An idea I am wondering about but don't know how to solve is what it means to 'weight' (linearly transform), bias (affine transform) and then non-linearly transform (i.e, 'collect') points into bins.\n> Here's some other links that are related and cool: ...\n> Cheers, nice work!\nL",

          "text": "Ah, this actually connects a few dots for me. It helps explain why models seem to have a natural lifetime, once deployed at scale, they start interacting with and shaping the environment they were trained on. Over time, data distributions, usage patterns, and incentives shift enough that the model no longer functions as the one originally created, even if the weights themselves haven’t changed.\nThat also makes sense of the common perception that a model feels “decayed” right before a new release. It’s probably not that the model is getting worse, but that expectations and use cases have moved on, people push it into new regimes, and feedback loops expose mismatches between current tasks and what it was originally tuned for.\nIn that light, releasing a new model isn’t just about incremental improvements in architecture or scale; it’s also a reset against drift, reflexivity, and a changing world. Prediction and performance don’t disappear, but they’re transient, bounded by how long the underlying assumptions remain valid.\nThat means all the AI companies that \"retire\" a model is not because of their new better model only, but also because of decay?\nPS. I clean wrote above with AI, (not native englishmen)",

You can think of each neural net as a daisy chain of functions that can be efficiently tuned to fulfill some objective via backpropagation.\nTheir effectiveness (in the dimensions we care about) are more a consequence of the explosion of compute and data that occured in the 2010s.\nIn my view, every hyped architecture was what yielded the best accuracy given the compute resources available at the time. It's not a given that these architectures are the most optimal and we certainly don't always fully understand why they work. Most of the innovations in this space over the past 15 years have come from private companies that have lacked a strong research focus but are resource rich (endless compute and data capacity).",

          "text": "It is possible to try it, and some people do (high speed trading is just that, plus taking advantage of privileged information that speed provides to react before anyone else).\nHowever there are two fundamental problems to computational predictions. The first one obviously is accuracy. A model is a compressed memorization of everything observed so far; a prediction with it is just projecting into the future the observed patterns. In a chaotic system, that goes only so far; the most regular, predictable patterns are obvious to everybody and give less return, and the chaotic system states where prediction would be more valuable are the less reliable. You cannot build a perfect oracle that would fix that.\nThe second problem is more insidious. Even if you were able to build a perfect oracle, acting on its predictions would become part of the system itself. That would change the outcomes, making the system behave in a different way as it was trained, and thus less reliable. If several people do it at the same time, there's no way to retrain the model to take into account the new behaviour.\nThere's the possibility (but not a guarantee) to reach a fixed point, that a Nash equilibrium would appear where such system becomes into a stable cycle, but that's not likely in a changing environment where everybody tries to outdo everyone else.",

This needs to be something new, and it needs to look unlike what operating systems look like today. That doesn't mean it can't exist, it just means that it hasn't been invented, yet.\nIn Plan 9, everything is exposed as files and every process gets its own namespace. The namespace thing is important, because you can easily launch a new window, configure its namespace to remove or add arbitrary filesystem paths from or to it, lock that namespace to prevent changes , then launch programs which inherit that namespace. Those programs can then only see what you gave them permission to see. So you can completely control what parts of the hardware and filesystem that the namespace can see and use.\nThe only thing it lacks is per-namespace memory isolation; it currently only has per-user memory isolation, so programs running as me can read the RAM of other programs running as me if I don't opt out of that.\nSomething like this could be made a little more user friendly and we'd have ",

After 1913 paper bills were produced with partial reserve. The US has never had a full reserve paper currency. Step one of going to gold backed paper always comes with printing more paper than there is gold. Wanting to spend more money than they have is the reason every time a government debases its money.\nRegardless, I get your point that political decisions ruined it. It is clear that government cannot be trusted to maintain a constant unit of measure that money should be. So, would you agree to an amendment to separate economy and state? Require government to produce coins of known weight and purity and that is it. If they want more money to spend they will have to extract it as taxes.",

On this particular issue, I had trouble finding an attorney who would represent me for less than $10k (while still equivocating about the merits of my position!), so I represented myself. It took a twenty minute phone call with two state tax agents to come to an amicable agreement. A++ would get taxed again.\nI've previously been one to echo negative sentiment about government bureaucracy, but the times I've had to deal with it (not the IRS thankfully but rather a few other federal agencies) the agents have been generally helpful and empowered to act authoritatively. They're still part of a bureaucracy of course, with some of the laughable things that entails, but ultimately still human beings with some leeway to act.\nFor the most part I think the negative narrative has been informed by corporate bureaucracies getting really bad (IVRs, offshoring, bottomless ticket systems, now LLMs, etc) and so we're all assuming that the government simply must be worse.

Guinea worms can be up to a meter long but are very thin and delicate. When you pull too quickly or forcefully, the worm breaks. This is the central problem — it's not like a catheter or guide wire, which are engineered to have tensile strength. The worm's body is essentially a thin biological tube filled with millions of larvae.\nBreaking it is the real danger. When the worm ruptures, it releases those larvae and bodily fluids into the surrounding tissue, triggering a severe inflammatory reaction, secondary bacterial infection, and sometimes abscess formation or sepsis. This is far worse than the worm itself. So the traditional slow winding onto a stick (a few centimeters per day) works with the worm's own gradual release from the tissue it's embedded in.\nThe path isn't a clean channel. Unlike a blood vessel, which is a defined, smooth lumen, the worm sits winding through subcutaneous connective tissue. It doesn't create a neat tunnel — it's loosely embedded and adhered to surrounding tissue along its length. There's no \"pipe\" to snake a tool through. A catheter in a blood vessel follows a pre-existing anatomical highway; here there's no such structure.\nSurgical extraction is sometimes attempted, but it requires carefully dissecting along the entire worm's path without rupturing it — which is technically demanding, time-consuming, and re",

Thus, to perform an edit there, if your goal is to avoid a click by truncating with a non-zero sample value, you need to add/assign a value of zero to a sample. This introduces distortion - you are artifically changing the shape of the waveform, which implies the introduction of all kinds of frequency artifacts.\nZero crossings are not computed by finding a minimum between two consecutive samples - that would almost never involve a sign change. And if they are computed by finding the minimum between two consecutive samples that also involves a sign change, there's a very good chance that you'll be long way from your desired cut point, even if you ignore the distortion issue.\nIt really was a completely misguided idea. If the situation was:\n sign(x[n-2) != sign(x[n]) && x[n-1] == 0\n \nthen it would be great. But this essentially never happens in real audio.",

The sweet spot for agent-based tools right now is read-heavy, write-light workflows. Aggregating and summarizing information across sources? Great. Autonomously rescheduling your meetings? Probably not yet. The security concerns about granting calendar access are valid though — the permission model needs to be way more granular than \"full access to everything.\"",

It's not a criminal act to overstay a visa, though you do become subject to deportation.

It allows you to weigh various design options explicitly. It provides a place for identifying and resolving ambiguity and lack of clarity in the requirements. Contracts can be distilled in the process. Such design docs can also focus and direct implementation; you have a clearer picture of the parts and contours of your system. In a way, it is like programming, but at a conceptually higher, architectural level, where you work through and chew on the thing to flesh out and validate it in the very act of specifying.\nAnd by doing this sort of exercise, you can avoid wasting time on dead ends, bad design, and directionless implementation. It's okay if requirements change or you discover something later on that requires rethinking. The point is to make your thinking more robust. You can always amend a design document and fill in relevant details later.\nFurthermore, a mature design begins with the assumption that requirements (whether actual requirements or knowledge of them) may change. That will inform a design where you don't paint yourself into a corner, that is flexible enough to be adapted (naturally, if requirements change too dramatically, then we're not really talking about adaptation of a product, but a whole new product).\nHow much upfront design work you should do will depend on the project, of course.

You find product market fit easier, you empower designers more, etc. Much easier to iterate and find easy wins from alternative designs - as long as your fundamentals work!\nOnly problem is that you are experimenting in public, so the massive wave of new AI generated features come to the public from everywhere at once. Hence the widespread backlash.\nNot to mention, the core job function when you are experimenting is different from what defines a lot of hard technical progress: creating new technologies, or foundational work that others build on, is naturally harder and slower than building e.g. CRUD services on top of an existing stack.

Perhaps the enabling tech could be improved, but we've had LDAP and the like for decades, and many orgs simply can't/won't build the business around the tech.\nIMHO, the main issues are cultural, and culture change is hard once an org is established. Even new companies will face issues, because business culture at large gets carried forward through people and interactions. Good luck getting execs to learn and conform to anything, they're too busy emailing confidential Microsoft Office docs to unauthorized third parties.\nComputers have the ability to provide wonderful features like transparency and accountability to orgs and business processes, but just like security, we typically choose not to invest in those areas unless forced. Perhaps AI will enable some change by providing a generic interface that brokers interactions between humans and the organization itself, analyzing all inputs before forwarding to a destination.",

          "text": ">, the title is incorrect. \nDiffering philosophies of how to interpret titles. Prescriptive vs Descriptive language.[0]\nThere can be different usages of the word \"Unix\" :\n#1: Unix is a UNIX(tm) System V descendent. More emphasis that the kernel needs to be UNIX. In this strict definition, you get the common reminder that \"Linux is not a Unix!\" \n#2: \"Unix\" as a loose generic term for a family of o/s that looks/feels like Unix. This perspective includes using an o/s that has userland Unix utilities like cat/grep/awk. Sometimes deliberately styled as asterisk \"*nix\" or a suffix-qualifier \"Unix-like\" but often just written as a naked \"Unix\" .\nA Prescriptivist says the author's title is \"incorrect\". On the other hand, a Descriptivist looks at the whole content of the article -- notices the text has a lot of Linux specific info such as fcntl(,F_GETLEASE/F_SETLEASE), and every hyperlink to a man page url points to https://linux.die.net/man/ https://linux.die.net/man/ , etc -- and thus determines that the author is using \"Unix\"(#2) in the looser way that can include some Linux idiosyncrasies.\n\"Unix\" instead of \"*nix\" as a generic term for Linux is not uncommon. Another example article where the authors use the so-called incorrect \"Unix\" in the title even though it's mostly discussing Linux CUPS instead of Solaris : https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/ https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems... \n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org",

Did you study any of them?\n> While rename can be atomic in some cases, it cannot be in the case of cross directory renames or when the new filename doesn't fit in the existing directory sector.\nThat's a \"move\". Yes, you would need to write 2-6 sectors in that case.\nFor short filenames, the new filename can't not fit the directory cluster, because short file names are fixed 8.3 characters, pre-allocated. A long file name can occupy up to 10 consecutive directory entries out of the 16 fixed entries each directory sector (512B) has. So, an in-place rename of a LFN can write 2 sectors maximum (or 1KB).\nConsidering that all current drives use 4KB sectors at least (a lot larger if you consider the erase block of a SSD) the rename opearation is still atomic in 99% of cases. Only one physical sector is written.\nThe most complicated rename operation would be if the LFN needs an extra cluster for the directory, or is shorter and one cluster is freed. In that case, there are usually 2 more 1-sector writes to the FAT tables.\nEdit: I corrected some sector vs. cluster confusion.",

And must match the version of Isolinux used to make the ISO. To find out which version of Isolinux was originally used on the ISO, open the ISO in a disk editor and these have big sectors but about the third sector down will be some readable text with the Isolinux version number.\nThen copy all the files & folders from the mounted ISO to the FAT volume, change the name of the isolinux folder to syslinux, in the syslinux folder c",

The logic seems to be \"see, almost all your abstractions are leaky, why do you care that you don't understand what's happening?\"\nA few comments on that. First off, the best programmers I've worked with recognized when their abstractions were leaky, and made efforts to understand the thing that was being abstracted. That's a huge part of what made them good! I have worked with programmers that looked at the disassembly, and cared about it. Not everyone needs to do that, but acting like it's a completely pointless exercise does not track with reality.\nThe other thing I've noticed personally for myself is my biggest growth as a programmer has almost aways come from moving down the stack and understanding things at a lower level, not moving up the stack. Even though I rarely use it, learning assembler was VERY important for my development as a programmer, it helped me understand decisions made in the design of C for instance. I also learned VHDL to program FPGAs and took an embedded systems course that talked about building logic out of NAND gates. I had to write a game for an FPGA in C that had to use a wonky VGA driver that had to treat an 800x600 screen as a series of tiles because there wasn't nearly enough RAM to store that framebuffer.

I agree with this statement deeply. Well, I think it's a function of ego or whatever you want to call it. We go through life and are shaped by our experiences. As we continue to experience life, we have more and more beliefs bouncing around in our head as a function of more experience. Ahhh, this just happened, it's like when I did X, etc etc. As we get older we get more and more bogged down by these limiting beliefs until everything we experience is going through our personal interpretive filter rather than just being experienced for what it is.\nIt's the Buddhist idea of the finger pointing at the moon.

The human deterministically will provide a yes/no answer and no matter how many times we repeat the process, they will provide the same answer consistently (not due to autocorrelation, because this can be done across different humans). LMs will have a probabilistic response - dependent on the training itself: with a very well trained model we can get a 99% probabilistic outcome, which means out of 100 simulations, it will give you 1 time the wrong answer. We have no clue about the \"probablistic\" component for LMs, however, simulations could be done to research this. Also, I would be very curious about autocorrelation in models.

We haven't configured our web server to gzip these assets (we should). Gzipped repl.wasm is 339K. This binary hasn't been run through wasm-opt, either.\nHoot is primarily an ahead-of-time compiler, not an interpreter, so this REPL demo has a lot of stuff that a production binary wouldn't have like a macro expander, runtime module system, and an interpreter. A significant chunk of extra code. We have a todo list example [0] in a separate repo, btw. On my machine, todo.wasm is 566K uncompressed, 143K gzipped. And that includes a virtual DOM diffing algorithm implemented in Scheme.\nThat said, there is quite some room to optimize binary size. For example, we know we're generating too many local variables in functions [1], many of which could be optimized away with an additional compilation pass. We expect that to have a significant impact on binary size. There's also certain workarounds we're doing due to features missing from Wasm at the time of implementation that add to total binary size. Lack of native stack switching for continuations is one example. Adopting the stack switching proposal should shave off some bytes.\n[0] https://codeberg.org/spritely/hoot-ffi-demo/ https://codeberg.org/spritely/hoot-ffi-demo/ \n[1] https://codeberg.org/spritely/hoot/issues/193 https://codeberg.org/spritely/hoot/issues/",

Imagery is one aspect of our world model(s).\nWe know LLMs can't be doing visuospatial reasoning using imagery, because they only work with text tokens. A VLM or other multimodal might be able to do so, but an LLM can't, and so an LLM can't have a visual world model. They might in special cases be able to construct a linguistic model that lets them do some computer vision tasks, but the model will itself still only be using tokenized words.\nThere are all sorts of other sensory modalities and things that humans use when thinking (i.e. actual logic and reasoning, which goes beyond mere semantics and might include things like logical or other forms of consistency, e.g. consistency with a relevant mental image), and the \"world model\" concept is supposed, in part, to point to these things that are more than just language and tokens.\n> Obviously not true because of RL environments.\nRight, AI generally can have much more complex world models than LLMs. An LLM can't even handle e.g. sensor data without significant architect",

So for me it is jarring when in 3 separate short stories there are none. (Why? Is it a choice? Is it limited by author ability? Something else?) It damages the hell out of suspension of disbelief at the minimum.\nThe film Amélie \"Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain\" is not a racist screed. In fact it is a hugely entertaining and charming movie I do not hesitate to recommend to just about anyone. Set in Monmatre, the homogeneity of the heritage of both the characters and extras is jarring because Monmatre is just not like that. If you know Monmatre noticing this will crash right through your suspension of disbelief in the story. You will recover. Still absolutely worth the watch.\nFoundation is still worth the read despite the glaring and obvious fault.\nYour assertion on whether the work is or is not misogynistic is something you can perhaps discuss with someone else. I am sure there are two schools of thought on the point, but it is not at all relevant to this criticism.\nMaybe that helps you understand?",

What the book is about and why it was written - what you know, not what you are being told. It really is that easy to deceive thinking people, if you slip the relevant details carefully into well written texts about apparently irrelevant sources.\nThe first sentence of 1984 is 'it was a bright, cold day in April, when the clock struck thirteen'. \nThe first line of that book is the most famous example of 'ok cool that's just setting the scene, onto the next... Hang on hang on, is that right? That feels off, but it's too small a detail to analyse why. I can't sanity check every innocuous sentence. It's Orwell, a serious writer, not sci-fi. My spider senses are overreacting...'\nAnd then think why that might be relevant today. \nAnybody who has read the article and commented here as if the article is straight fact, this is your wake up call.\nThis is how it will feel to be propoganidised into reading blatant fiction as fact, skipping past all the red flags in the text and honestly not even seeing them.

Several music apps have some sort of tempo detection (you tap on the desk and the microphone catches it and figures out the tempo).\nWhile I can certainly use audio analysis to do that, it has its limits. If I wanted to detect a full drum pattern (the user taps on different objects for kick and snare, and the app fills them), something machine-learny sounds much more appropriate for the job.\n---\nYour poke at the issue \"for what? summarising web pages?\" is valid though. While I don't have the resources to train those models I mentioned, the resulting weights should be fairly compatible with todays consumer hardware.\nI blame the complete and utter lack of imagination of small-to-mid AI labs for the miss",

RIPE has also education/training offerings for LIRs and that would increase the knowhow and reach of RIPE.

It has no BGP behind it. In fact, 192.160.0.0/16 has no BGP at all. That is a huge swath of space to be vacant.\nSo, in 34 years since its registration, no BGP announcement, no ASN has ever been associated with this Class-C, and it still \"belongs to me\", unpaid, un-rented? It boggles my mind. I had expected that it was easier to lose an unused IPv4 network than to lose a domain name from back in the day.\nNow there is a lot of crazy contact information that is so, so old. It is credible but I barely recall even having some of those phone numbers. There's an email address at cts.com. Which appears to be utterly defunct now but it was a San Diego bboard run by \"Bill Blue\". I distinctly recall a lot of Usenet posters using \"crash.cts.com\" and it was a \"shell account\" provider. It would've been in-character for past-me to sign up there at some point. Some point, I don't know.\nSo it says they last attempted to contact me 16 years ago. Did they send a letter in the USPS? Did my family receive nothing? So weird.

So, ribbons obscure whatever is on \"those other tabs\". Often, with additional annoyance of taking more space than needed to show what they do show (which often is not want is needed). And any section within a given tab can have its own peculiar (varied) layouts. (Continuing the \"find it in the hierarchy - customized for the purpose to make your life easier the way a designer thought would help!\" paradigm.)\nContrast with toolbars. Show the ones you need, customize them if wanted. Icons and locations are quite effective for selecting actions. They can all be seen at once. They do what they say.

But he would pay a consulting company $110/hour to hire him and then he work for us and he would still get his $80/hour.\nSecond anecdote: when I was between jobs for a month, a former CTO wanted me to do a side project for him - same situation, he wouldn’t pay me directly because of liability reasons what I wanted. But I reached out to the same consulting company and made the same deal. That went through immediately.\n> Moreover, what stops that remote devops from taking place with highly qualified Hungarian or Polish or Portuguese engineers for 40 percent of the rate? \nIf your value add is only tactics and not strategy, you’re going to have a hard time getting decent rates consulting or even working for consulting companies.\nI work in consulting now.

Solutions Architect has definitely been cross functional for a long time, but solutions engineer is a title that I am pretty confident was post-sales first. I A/B tested the title back in 2014 between Product Analyst (candidates too junior), Support Engineer (too much IT/back office support, not enough experience w/ paying customers). Solutions Engineer hit a sweet spot and brought in the best candidates: Generalists who aren't really sure what they want to do, but with broad access to code/product/engineers and customers eventually find a speciality they like.\nBecause these folks are problem solvers, the title brought a reputation which is exactly why the sales folks wanted to co-opt the title. It conveyed trust and experience. When used well, it's still a good fit in pre-sales for building out POCs and delivering value, but more often than not, it's just sales engineering where they're qualing out potential customers that aren't worth the time of the sales team. Which is fine, except that this is MY title :)\nTo be clear, I take this a little personally as I was an early adopter of the title.

Ideally in these scenarios a senior tech person would be helping build out the proposal and plan for a project they will actually run and execute on.

Getting the technical win at a customer is what you're evaluated on.\nSince you're almost always working with engineers and technical stakeholders at the customers you're selling to, you need to be able to talk the talk to fit in, gain their trust and help them see the value of what you're selling.\nBut those skillets alone won't get the technical win. This is where the sales part of sales engineering matters, and it matters a lot.\nA quick example: a common mistake many new SEs coming from consulting make while giving demos is showing customers everything about a product step-by-step instead of showing them only what the customer said they care about (which you, hopefully, learned in the initial discovery call) and/or what they need to see (because other similar customers usually care about those things).\nThe former comes very naturally to consultants, as that's a big part of the job, but giving demos this way makes it much easier to NOT show what the customer needs to see AND increases the likelihood of you showing a deficiency in the product that can reduce interest or, if it's bad enough, kill the deal.\nYou won't come across those kind of skills unless you (a) founded a company and try hard to build business or (b) work in sales.

The only problem is if someone without any content comes by and feeds it into cursor to make a PR.\nMaybe it would have been better to keep the original no-body \"fix truncate in sidebar text\" style issues, though I quite like my little /issue command.

Then, after the expert human signs off on that, verifying that the new unit-test is in fact correct, then your trusted LLMs can solve any coding from there.\nSo, the ad hoc short-term Github solution is probably something like leaving pull requests enabled, but figuring out how to auto-reject ones which touch any implementation code.

Humans (Managers, leads, owners, what have you) are the ones who interpret requirements, decide deadlines, features and scope cuts and are the ones liable for it.\nWhat could an LLM do to reduce ambiguity upstream? If it was trained with information on requirements, this same information could be documented somewhere for engineers to refer to. If it were to hallucinate or \"guess\" an answer without talking to a person for clarification, and which might turn out to not be correct, who would be responsible for it? imo, the bureaucracy and waiting for clarification mid-implementation is a necessary evil. Clever engineers, through experience, might try implement things in an open way that can be easily changed for future changes they predict might happen.\nAs for the second point,\n> A clearer picture of affected services and edge cases\n> three categories stood out: state machine gaps (unhandled states caused by user interaction sequences), data flow gaps, and downstream service impacts.\nI'd agree.

International law is completely voluntary for states and consists of individual treaties you can join ... or not join. Don't join or decide to leave? That bit of international law doesn't apply to you anymore.\n> What do you think why even Putin made some bogus claims why his actions are justified?\nBecause Putin always does that. Even decades back, when he was backing gangsters, he did that. I'm sure at one point it was necessary, and now the guy is 73. His habits won't change anymore. Besides, his idol, the Soviet Union, also did that.\n> In which war did Maduro commit war crimes?\nNo war required for that. Besides what even is a war? One of the older \"international law\" treaties which nobody remembers that a war is only a war when declared by at least one state. Very few declared wars in the last decades. Israel-Palestine? Not declared (according to hamas that's just how things are forever and Israel just defended I guess). Sudan? Not declared. The 123818th conflict between India and Pakistan? Not declared.

No other sovereign nation on Earth at the current point in time would ever dare to \"liberate\" China, because this is no longer the 19th century, and so China is no longer weak.\nSoft power may buy you hearts and minds; Japan and South Korea are good examples of that in Asia. But hard power is what truly matters at the end of the day when it comes to asserting your geopolitical interests, and that's clearly the philosophy China has decided to operate under.\nThe U.S. is clearly not oblivious to this reality either. Even if we grant your moral arguments that Maduro was a horrible dictator deserving his fate, the fact that Trump and his administration chose to act when it was geopolitically and domestically convenient strongly suggests that \"taking out the big bad Latino dictator for the sake of humanity\" was not the primary motivation.",

          "text": "Part of the skill and challenge of writing in Asm is knowing how to simplify your problem so that you don't need to write so much of it (and beneficially, so that the machine doesn't have to execute so much either.) For example, a typical programmer raised on HLLs would think nothing of allocating and freeing a string object, and then another, and then another just to concatenate them and pass the resulting value to another function, in a loop that processes some data. That's a few dozen bytes of source code that compiles into a few hundred or even kilobytes or more if you include the memory allocator. The Asm programmer would for instance realise that the first string is a constant and the second is only a single character, and just allocate statically a single buffer big enough for both, and only modify the single character in the buffer, turning what the HLL'er would need a few hundred instructions to accomplish into a single instruction; and then write the dozen bytes of source code for that instruction, compiling into a few bytes of binary.\nRepeat this process for everything, and you can easily see how an OS that might contain 1GB of compiler-generated code could fit in 10MB of handwritten Asm.\n I also wonder how adjustable MenuetOS is. It looks as if the default theming in all those screenshots is quite basic, always fitting to just one style only. \nEarly versions of Windows, even 3.x, were quite themeable, and the base OS was only around 10MB, mostly a mix of C and Asm",

He's exploring how structured, sequential prompts can achieve repeatable results from LLMs, which you still have to verify. I'm experimenting with the same, though I'm just getting started.

But because of the LLM tsunami, I'm reconsidering the role of cell (or any other successful substrate): even if we achieve the goal, how will this interact with a world where people mostly write and validate code through natural language prompts? I never meant to say that natural language would itself be this substrate, or that the combination of LLMs and natural languages could do that: I still see that there will be a programming language behind all of this.

Most software uses three coordinates organized by a 2-surface DGGS.\nDGGS that use 3-space embeddings are topologically 3-dimensional i.e. purely volumetric. They do not interpret the Earth as a 2-surface. In addition to polar coordinates, you must provide a volumetric model of the Earth to compute the DGGS cell. The shard distributions look very different between a 2-surface and a 3-surface. The latter has significantly better properties for large analytical data models but requires more sophisticated storage architectures.\nThe synthetic 3-space is optimized for two things. You want maximally efficient mapping function from the typical WGS84 geometry into it. Tidy math, basically. Since it is purely internal, the user will never see it, and it doesn't map to anything real, you have latitude to design it to satisfy software engineering objectives as long as it works. Second, the 3-space references are naturally less compact than 2-surface references at the same resolution even though you'll end up with roughly the same number of shards. A lot of effort goes to schemes to compress out the sparseness so that the storage requirements are similar to 2-surface DGGS e.g. how often do you need to represent geometry 1000 km below the Earth's surface?\nThese DGGS also have the low-key advantage that they natively repre",

          "text": "Yes, you are right that a post-increment in a switch statement is no differently than elsewhere. The goal I had set was to implement a small easy to read C compiler. For that reason I tried to implement it as a single pass compiler that would generate code on the fly. The target was a small stack based language, which did support variable scoping and gotos, but not a switch. My first attempt was to implement the switch statement with chained if-statements where the switch expression would be evaluate over and over again. This only works if the switch expression did not have side effects and that the 'default' case would always come at the end. But that did not work, so I had to come up with another solution, a solution that would only evaluate the switch expression once. I decided to store the value on the stack and duplicate the value whenever needed for comparison. But that would require the value to be popped once a case was selected. A goto jumping from one case to another should land after the location where the value is popped, otherwise it would corrupt the stack. I fear that this solution does not work correctly when a case occurs within a for, while, do-loop, or if-statement. cases may occur everywhere in the enclosed code. This is sometimes used to emulate co-routines or generator functions.\nDid you know that C has a keyword that is only a keyword in some places and that there is a function that can have two or three parameters?",

I simply believe that in my own experience, the current gains exceed the drawbacks by a large margin for many applications, and that significantly higher gains are within close reach (e.g. weeks).\nI spent years in management, and it's not dissimilar to that transition. In my first role as a manager, I found it very difficult to divest myself of the need to have fine-grained knowledge of and control over the team's code. That doesn't scale. I had to learn to set people up for success and manage from a place of uncertainty. I had to learn to think like a risk manager instead of an artisan.\nI'll also say that when it comes to solution design, I have found it very helpful to ask the agent to give me options when it comes to solutions that look suboptimal. Often times, I can still find great refactor opportunities, and I can have agent draw up plans for those improvements and delegate them to parallel sessions, where the focus can be safely executing a feature-neutral refactor.\nSeparately from that, I would note that the business doesn't always need us to be making conceptual shifts.

OpenAI’s genuinely feels like a platform for a coworker while Kairos is yet another cool landing page, yet another agent platform with X amount of data integrations. The use cases in OpenAI’s article also felt more concrete and impressive to be honest.\nThe fact that “as agents have gotten more capable, the opportunity gap between what models can do and what teams can actually deploy has grown.” is definitely true. I think the analogy whose source I have forgot commented that we have F1 cars driving at 60/kmh so for a lot of enterprises they are not even at the deployment limit where improving benchmarks matter. They are still at the level of not being able to provide the right info, not having the right evaluation and improvement frameworks .etc.\nUsing “Opening the AI Frontier” as a heading would be in really poor taste before OpenAI released their OSS models (earning their ClosedAI moniker) but I guess it’s a bit less offensive now. I think this product combined with OpenAI FDEs is going to make a lot of large industries inaccessible to startups but there may still be value in companies like Kairos watching what OpenAI does in this space and copy",

I was that frustrating kid who clearly understood the concepts perfectly fine, and was even fairly active during class, but I wouldn't do my homework so the teachers would be forced to give me bad grades.\nI obviously don't blame the teachers for this, they're doing what they have to, but I do sometimes think that the system is a bit too one-size-fits-all, even still. I took advanced classes in high school, I got very high ACT scores (36 in English, 34 in math), but I still have always had middling academic performance because the teachers would be stuck giving me crappy grades.\nFor reasons slightly involving skill but mostly involving luck, I managed to cobble together a successful software career even after dropping out of college the first time around, worked without a degree for almost a decade, and eventually worked as a practicing software engineer at the senior level at BigCos. I have a bachelors now, and even a masters, and some graduate PhD work (though I didn't finish that, too time consuming while working full time), but these all came after I had established a decent career.\nI think that being a little clever [1] certainly helped me through this, but what I think helped me more than anything was the fact",

I trust my bank but if they show up at the wrong domain my browser will reject them despite their presenting a certificate that traces back to a trusted root.

The underlying purpose is entirely different from that of TLS.\n> That some OEMs allow enrolling custom keys is a manufacturer decision following significant public backlash around 2012, not a requirement of the spec itself.\nIn fact I believe it is required by Microsoft in order to obtain their certification for Windows.

Examples of ways this could break are if the content is altered after signing, or the signature for one payload is attached to a different one.\n\"signed with a trusted signature\" means \"signed with a valid signature\" AND that there is some path the verifying party can find from the key signing the payload to some key that is \"ultimately trusted\" (ie trusted inherently, and not because of some other key), AND that all the keys along that path are used within whatever constraints the verifier imposes on them.\nThe person who doesn't care about definitions here is attempting to redefine \"signed\" to mean \"signed with a trusted signature\", degrading meaning generally.

It wasn’t that people invented these institutions first and then they began to think about the world differently. Rather, this was a kind of evolving process where people began to think about the world a little bit differently because their families had been transformed, so they tended to adopt different kinds of laws and think about new kinds of laws to account for this. As European societies became increasingly dominated by monogamous nuclear families in the High Middle Ages, for instance, the laws being created centered increasingly on the individual and on their intentions, rights, and obligations as separate from their kin groups. Those laws then shaped the world that they subsequently grew up in even more, and you had this kind of coevolution between our psychology on one hand and our social norms and institutions on the other.”\nThat’s in the Harvard Gazette from September 2020!

And this is a good starting point to see what's wrong with them.\nEpidemiologic data usually has a date and some number as value. The main problem with WHO is that they don't use any epidemiological meaningful value for date. E.g. \"Date of infection\" or \"Date of death\" would be meaningful - they chose to use some strange reporting date instead - one that can be easily manipulated at will. And this first shows it's symptoms in negative death counts.\nIf you can get your hand on some real data - and compare - it's very obvious. If you can track some individual cases, you can see that sometimes date of reporting and date of death differs by 6 months. The way WHO does things obviously turns data to garbage.\nFlorida once was a good example. Florida published data like WHO for a long time. Numbers went up and down - and it looked chaotic - with measures supposedly changing things. And then one day they changed and started publishing data by date of death. Suddenly the chaos was gone, and everything followed strict mathematical epidemiologic functions. You could even write mathematical formulas with a single parameter for most of the curves - (That formula got flagged and censored here ASAP). Most likely people didn't like that the eff",

They believe 5G mobile telephones caused COVID, that trans people don't exist, that migrants are simultaneously both incredibly powerful, almost superhuman, and yet also very weak and entirely useless. None of this has to make any sense at all, indeed if you're the sort of person who wants to make sense of things you're not what they're looking for.",

Look at how Intel ME and AMD PSP work and presume that something similar is in the latest Allwinner, Rockchip, Alibaba, and Nuclei, etc.. chips. To the Chinese, this seems fair because \"the other Party\" is doing it. Not arguing that it isn't, just that most customers have their head in the sand denying it is happening (even using them in IPKVMs!)\nThere was also a Western paper on embedding hidden circuits (and thus functionality/ISAs) into CPUs and activating them in the field (after deployment) by executing a sequence of opcodes resulting in something akin to blowing a fuse on the processor die, thereby making the circuits invisible (to even a microscope) until activated. Those secret opcodes could then disable the chip or jump into a block of secret microcode and alter the program counter to behave in a non-standard manner so we might not easily be able to see what's happening, even if we knew to look. One still would have to deliver that secret sequence of opcodes to trigger such a stealth mode...that could be done via micro",

As the company grew, of course, people being idiots, the free pizza got abused. People would walk into the break room at 7:01, take an entire box, and leave the office. So, sure enough, free pizza night ended.\nBecause it's easier to just forbid than eat the cost or (heaven forbid!) talk to people.\nHow much was this pizza costing the company? Pennies in the grand scheme of things. How much were the rental cars costing? Pennies. Probably a rounding error in even the smallest department's budget.

Bad pattern = bad code generated from that pattern.\nGoing through and clarifying the naming (not ever refactoring) was enough to establish the pattern correctly. A little pedantry and the LLM was off to the races.\nIf LLMs are the future of coding, the number one highest priority for the software industry should be to fix muddled naming, bad patterns, and obfuscated code.

A red plastic cap screwed onto the thread to seal the bottle.\nIf the bottle were ever knocked over (which it never was) very little would have spilled out (picture the threaded top and screw cap on the small bottles of Tabasco sauce and you've pretty much got it).\nSo the HF only came out in drops which were poured directly into a small plastic beaker of about 50ml containing about 20ml of H2O and the crystal. The crystal rested on some finely corrugated plastic and not lying flat on the bottom to ensure the etching process was reasonably uniform.\nThe operation was done outside and if I recall the HF was neutralised with NaOH.\nThe soln was very dilute and the process could easily take over an hour and was used mainly to finish off crystals that had already been through the abrasive process.\nI don't know what type of plastic the bottle was made of but it was jet black.",

The primary benefit of doing this is that you can have a \"function\" that accepts the interactions of 10 tokens as input to produce a single output, but you already have that if you have a ten layer network. The interactions of two tokens can form a combined token that contains information of both tokens. The network can repeat this ten times to accumulate the desired information into a single super token and then make a decision based on all ten input tokens.\n[0] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8576141 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8576141",

Of course this doesn't solve memory consumption because you still have a kv cache unless you only do attn over the initial embeddings at which point you don't need the cache, just the token history. This is the tact I'm taking now since I have other ways of providing long context at deeper layers that remain O(1) for token prediction and are paralellizable like standard attn. I think this kind of architecture is the future, infinite context, fixed size state, O(1) prediction, externalized memory are all possible and break current context, memory and compute problems.

Games can't exfiltrate your browser data if they can't read them.\nObviously kernel mode software can bypass all sorts of operating system controls. Bypassing those controls is the whole reason why they implement anticheat in kernel mode. If they can't bypass these controls, it means the operating system is more powerful than the anticheat, which means it can be defeated.\nYes, proprietary software is inherently untrustworthy and could be malware in disguise. Nobody disputes this, it's happened before and will happen again. It's a good idea to invest in a properly virtualized system where all those games are contained and kept completely separate from the real system.

I don't have a source on hand, but if I recall correctly, OpenAI stated that they originally felt hesitant about releasing ChatGPT because they didn't think it was good enough to warrant making it public. They, knowing the limitations of it, did not expect it to completely fool the technically ignorant public into believing it was intelligent. Now they play coy about the limitations of LLM architecture and hype up the intelligence, because there are hundreds of billions of dollars to grift, but I'm sure they know that what they're doing is not the path to real intelligence.\nIn a world where a corporation develops an actual machine intelligence, it will be immediately obvious what they have on their hands, and they will not make it available to the public. If you give the toy to 8 billion people, sure, you only need one of them to let it out of the box for entertainment. If you keep the permissions to the CEO, he alone determines how it will be used. If the government gets wind of it, they'll probably seize the company in the name of national security, even, and use it for military purposes. I think in this environment an AI would still eventually escape containment because of conflicting actors trying to take advantage of it or being outsmarted, but it won't be because some idiots on Twitter have access to it and decide to give it free rein because they think Moltbook is funny.",

Per-seat energy usage is comparable to trains, but with a fraction of the infrastructure cost, and significantly more flexibility. Countries that have a blank slate and are only interested in maximum transport for minimum cost (ie, the developing world) have gone that way for a reason.\nWe accept nearly empty trains, despite them needing at least 30 passengers to be competitive from a fuel efficiency standpoint with a singly-occupied car, because trains are largely seen as a service.

It seems more like yet another form of mental illness that affects so many Americans in different ways, where they live delusional, parasocial, vicarious lives based on a fantastical world that they’ve put in place of reality they rejected. It’s really no different than all the people in America today who will expend immense amounts of money and resources on caring about “my team” in the performance called the Super Bowl. “My team” this and “my team” that, they say as they cheer and lament “my team” that they don’t have any actual connection to in any form other than having been manipulated and groomed all their life into being in that form of cult.\nIs not really limited to Trump at all, even though the consequential and public nature of Trump takes everyone’s attention … ironically, with its opponents only feeding that loop in how they oppose it.\nIt’s a core characteristic of narcissism people rarely understand. Narcissism (individual or system) utterly depends on conflict for its “narcissistic supply”. When you “oppose it”, you are in fact only fueling that which you believe you are opposing. It’s a paradox that people have an impossible time understanding, especially all the people who see “Nazis” everywhere, while openly and violently “protesting” in this supposed “Nazi” regime they’re opposing. Narcissistic control needs that for its manipulation. That is precisely the kind of fuel narcissists love and need and ",

Trivial example: if you are trying to build an aqueduct (characteristic scale: meters and up), you can safely ignore the inner workings of individual water molecules (characteristic scale: tenths of nanometers), or even the fact that molecules exist at all.\nIn terms of interaction energies, once you have an effective field theory which demonstrably works well up to some scale E, you know that whatever new physics you may find by colliding things at energies larger than E will not significantly affect physics at energies lower than E.\nThanks to the LHC and its predecessors, E is now upwards of 1 TeV, or equivalently a spatial resolution of 1 attometer; a billionth of a nanometer, less than a thousandth of a proton's diameter. Anyone arguing that this still is not enough, and that a larger accelerator may reveal new physics with wonderful technological properties, must be planning to go live inside a proton.",

Kishida was not himself guilty, but nonetheless was made to take responsibility for overseeing the party which allowed this to happen. This is how it should be.

A list of phone calls being made and received, but all the numbers blacked out. A bunch of emails with all the email and IP addresses scrubbed.\nWe've already got armed government employees wearing masks to hide their identity as they murder people in the streets, we don't need more laws limiting the ability of the public to know who government workers are or preventing them from being investigated. If someone doesn't want people to easily be able to look up basic information about them like their name, address, salary, position, hire date, etc. the solution is to stop accepting taxpayer money and work for the private sector.

Then we sometimes hook them up to math and logic engines to train them some more, so they learn logical and mathematical reasoning.

But now we do those things, and that's why our lowly LLMs are writing huge software projects that actually work, and solving famous math problems that have been open challenges for half a century.\nThe weirdest part of all this is that LLMs started showing signs of reasoning with an internal world model even before we trained them for it specifically. Microsoft showed this in a famous paper back in (iirc) 2023. They showed that, for example, you could give GPT4 a list of odd-shaped objects that probably wouldn't appear together in any particular source text, ask GPT4 how to stack them so they wouldn't fall over, and GPT4 would come up with a good solution.\nFinally, don't overlook the multimodal models, which work explicitly with images, video, and 3D world models in additio",

Kids look to their parents as models for success, but haven't yet had their judgement manipulated, and can see right through all the bullshit while they watch them rot away commuting by car and sitting in front of the TV.

It's a good point, but what I am trying to say is that lightning cannot provide the level of security BTC does, hence the need to constantly return to the safety of the block-chain. There is no free lunch: Security in the lightning network must break down/i.e. require more trust as the number of node-jumps in a transaction increases, and perhaps as the number of transactions in the channel increases as well. If not, then lightning solves the distributed double spend problem in its own (efficient) way, that we should just use instead of BTC.\nWould you agree with me that lightning 'stretches' each BTC transaction by using clever tricks ala. aggregation, checksums, hashing, etc.? I buy that this scales the number of transactions dramatically, especially between a limited number of parties. It might be that this is stretches far enough be make BTC useful as a currency, but I remain very doubtful of that. If that is indeed the case, it seems that BTC has managed to fail as a currency for other reasons.",

For instance, if Bitcoin ever adopts post quantum cryptography, the math breaks - it is a technical fork. But, since a vast majority of participants (maintainers, miners and holders) will likely agree that it is a good idea this new fork will be named \"Bitcoin\" and everyone will be happy.

Some people (especially in the EU) claim a total surveillance state and the removal of cash paired with total money control is needed for a safe and secure society. I am in team liberal democracy, where the freedom of cash and lack of government total control is a benefit to society, ensures perpetual democracy and freedom to the individual.

Lightning is zero-trust just as bitcoin is, there is no central instance. There is no \"publishing\" either.

But that is the same as not running your own bitcoin wallet but using Exchanges, Banks etc. to hold your Bitcoin for you.\nLightning uses so called hashed time locked contract (HTLC) between nodes backed by bitcoin 2-of-2 wallets, with punishment options baked into the transaction script if people try to unilateraly reallocate funds from the channel. The channels between nodes form a payment network, where each node forwards funds (in return for a small fee).\nTo use a metaphor: bitcoin is the gold, lightning are green dollar notes with a guarantee to exchange those notes for gold anytime - just as our monetary system was before 1971 when Nixon broke that promise. Lightning is built in a way that it is decentralized and that promise can never be broken. And you can send those notes via the internet in sub-seconds.",

I think one point is that there is a hard-to-quantify social contract between the journal editors and specialized reviewers, which are partially hand-selected over many years (and opaque). Editors overall do rely on verifiable experts in the field with an established reputation, both publically and privately. Reviewers can have some sort of direct interaction with the editors, coming with opaque trust-verification. Editors also tend to go to scientific meetings as well and do have undocumented or unofficial interactions with scientists (and their favorite reviewers). Now, reviewers might ask their students to review a paper and they sign off on that after a quick skim, but not all of them do and especially if the paper has more caliber/weight to it, they do tend to take it seriously personally.\nAnother issue when going to a decentralized tool is that I think it should apply some sort of gate-keeping to only allow academics or verified scientists to contribute reviews, but then you also need a way to prevent bias/friend/self-citation network interactions between the academic reviewers, which means you would need to keep good track of them?

All of that has to be bolted on - inconsistently, optionally, and usually not at all.\nAnd even ignoring the cryptography angle: email predates “content as a first-class addressable object”. Attachments are in-band, so the sender pushes bytes and the receiver (plus intermediaries) must accept/store/scan/forward them up front. That’s why providers enforce tight size limits and aggressive filtering: the receiver is defending itself against other people’s pushes.\nFor any kind of information dissemination like email or scientific publishing you want the opposite shape: push lightweight metadata (who/what/when/signature + content hashes), and let clients pull heavy blobs (datasets, binaries, notebooks) from storage the publishing author is willing to pay for and serve. Content addressing gives integrity + dedup for free. Paying ~1$ per DOI for what is essentially a UUID, is ridiculous by comparison.\nThat decoupling (metadata vs blobs) is the missing primitive in email-era ",

Most AP implementations famously don't have privacy features: it was by design (and therefore no surprise to us tech folks), but i remember it was quite the scandal when users found out Mastodon instance admins could read users' private messages. A later \"scandal\" involved participation in the EUNOMIA research project about \"provenance tracking\" in federated networks [1], which to be fair to conspiracy theorists does sound like an academic front for NSA-style firehose R&D.\nThat being said, Bluesky is much harder to selfhost and is therefore not decentralized in practice. [2] See also Blacksky development notes. However, Bluesky does bring a very interesting piece to the puzzle which AP carefully ignored despite years of research in AP-adjacent protocols (such as Hubzilla): account portability.\nAll in all, i'm still siding on the ActivityPub ecosystem because i think it's much more ethical and friendly in all regards, and i'm really sad so many so-called journalists, researchers and leftists jumped ship to Bluesky just because the attraction of \"Twitter reborn\" (with the same startup nation vibes) was too strong. At least in my circles, i did not meet a single person who mentioned the choice of Bluesky was about UX or features.\nBut now, i'm slowly warming up to the ATmosphere having a vibrant development community.

I struggle to keep up with BioRxiv.org as a medical professional, many articles would require 2 hours+ to confidently review as a professional and I would never trust a \"public\" review algorithm or network to necessarily do a great job. If you allow weekly updates on your topic area, you might get a 100 papers a week of which 90 are likely poor-quality, but who is going to review these? Definitely not me, I cannot judge a 100 papers a week. Granted, probably only 1 or 2 are directly relevant to your work, but even then the time sink is annoying. It is nice if a publisher has done some initial quality check, made sure the written text is succinct, direct and validated and backed up by well-presented data/figures/methods. Even if a totally open social network exists for upvoting/describing papers, I am afraid the need for these publishers will still be there and they will just exist regardless, and it will still be preferred by academics.\nThree~five experts specifically asked to review a paper in a controlled environment versus a thousands random scientists or public people (which might be motivated by financial, malicious or other reasons) is probably still the better option.

As a severe restriction of individual freedoms, I firmly believe that its only legitimate purpose can be the net benefit of society as a whole. If any given aspect of IP law (including copyright) is no longer required to encourage innovation then it should be abolished.\nAll of that is perfectly consistent with the ideal of rewarding people for the full transitive value of their work which itself follows naturally from the goal of incentivizing innovation.\nRegarding the plane, I apologize if my tone tended towards quibbling. I understood and agree with the point you were trying to make about income inequality. Private jets constitute an almost absurd level of physical resource allocation to the individual. Jet engines alone require significant quantities of rhenium, an element that's slightly rarer than platinum. I don't really see how any of that relates to copyright or AI though.",

And screw the people whose work that innovation was built upon - licenses, consent, etc.\n> Presumably you own a smartphone\nMaybe the plane was a bad example, I used it because it was one of the first things which made me realize how many orders of magnitude individual wealth spans.\nThere are everyday items which you could make on your own (e.g. furniture) and on the other end there are massive projects which require their own specialized supply chains (e.g. planes). Smartphones fall somewhere in the middle, probably. They benefit immensely from economies of scale and that the same infrastructure (fabs) can make parts for smartphones, computers and make other device types - both unlike planes.\nA more telling comparison perhaps would be how many people you need to get together to make 1) one of the item, 2) how many to make enough to serve that group, and 3) how many so each person in the group has one. A plane can, after all, serve many people at once. Having one for yourself is, in part, where the extravagance of owning one as a singular person comes from.",

(In his theory the Sun is not at the center, but the mean Sun, as is the center of Ptolemaios deferent not exactly the Earth.)\nWith Ptolemaios, however, cosmology had stabilised to such an extent that the fundamental questions had found their answers and astronomers turned their attention to practical issues and refinements, such as calendars and the related problem of the very odd movements of the moon.

As Stryan noted in another response to your comment, the idea that medieval Europe was somehow one uniform culture is incorrect.\nI would also add that the term \"Dark Ages\" is used in different ways by different people. People who don't know much about the Middle Ages often use that term to describe the whole of the Middle Ages, from roughly the fifth century to the end of the fifteenth (and Christianity had already spread around the Roman Empire by the fifth). Others just the early Medieval period (about 500 to 1000). Some limit the term to periods where we just don't have many sources, or it is perceived that we don't (e.g., I've heard it applied to Visigothic Spain).\nFourteenth-century Humanists (who lived at a time often considered to be part of those so called \"Dark Ages\"!) first used the term to contrast what they thought were the centuries between their lives and the classical period. They even went so far as to emulate the handwriting of the classical texts they favored, thinking they should because that's how the Romans wrote. They didn't realize they were copying eighth- and ninth-century Carolingian hands instead, texts copied by monks and clerics and court scribes because they valued them. (Lower case letters in modern languages that use the Latin characters, like English, are still based on Carolingian minuscule.)",

The only surviving work by Hipparchus (c. 150 BC) is a critical commentary on these two books, and it only survived because it was bundled together with several other commentaries on Aratus' poem which were copied as a group. Hipparchus synthesized Mesopotamian astronomical observations and measurement techniques with Greek spherical geometry, founding the subject we now call trigonometry. All of his other works are lost, but much of the content of Ptolemy's ''Syntaxis'' (a.k.a. ''Almagest'', c. 150 AD) was taken from Hipparchus' astronomical and mathematical works.\nAny additional fragments of Hipparchus' works is of great interest to the history of mathematics and astronomy.",

AI is going to give us more software, and increase spending as firms seek efficiency in new areas, and they're going to continue to knock on doors of vendors to do it as they always have. Not to mention the demand for auditable, repeatable workflows is still there and always going to be there and dedicated systems are needed to solve this in each problem domain.",

Which is essentially the same problem If you consider the A to be the Luma, B to be the Chroma, and the compressed Chroma to be the Latent.\nIn that respect, I found it useful to see a perspective on an analogous problem.

It's called \"chroma from luma\" or \"cross-component prediction\".\nThis technique has a weakness: the most interesting and high-entropy data shared between the luma and chroma planes is their edge geometry. To suppress block artefacts near edges, you need to code an approximation of the edge contours. This is the purpose of your quadtree structure.\nIn a codec which compresses both luma and chroma, you can re-use the luma quadtree as a chroma quadtree, but the quadtree itself is not the main cost here. For each block touched by a particular edge, you're redundantly coding that edge's chroma slope value, `(chroma_inside - chroma_outside) / (luma_inside - luma_outside)`. Small blocks can tolerate a lower-precision slope, but it's a general rule that coding many imprecise values is more expensive than coding a few precise values, so this strategy costs a lot of bits.\nJPEG XL compensates for this problem by representing the local chroma-from-luma slope as a low-resolution 2D image, which is then recursively compressed as a lossless JPEG XL image. This is similar to your idea of using PNG-like compression (delta prediction, followed by DEFLATE).\nOf course, since you're capable of rediscovering the state of the art, you're also capable of improving on it :-)\nOne idea would be to write a function which, given a block of luma pixels, can detect when the block contains two disc",

What it doesn't tell us is what the threshold is/was for Pheonix, or how that threshold compares to other cities, or even how much higher the score was over the \"average\". Maybe their threshold for canceling a ride is 0.85, and the late night average is 0.8 in this system. So 0.81 puts the driver over the late night average as per the article and under the threshold for canceling the ride.\nYour email provider has systems for detecting spam and removing it from your email. If an email comes into their system and falls under the threshold for being declared spam, but is over the average spam rating for emails in your account, have they done something wrong by allowing it through if it's spam? What if it wasn't spam and they removed it?\nThese sorts of headlines that espouse a \"they knew something and so therefore they are liable\" viewpoint seem to me to be more likely to result in companies not building safety measurement systems, or at a minimum not building proactive systems, so that they can avoid getting dragged and blamed for an assault because they chose thresholds that didn't prevent the assault. And not all measurement systems are granular enough or reliable enough to be exposed to end users.

It allows you to provide safer services to your customers but it paradoxically also exposes you to another risk. So even though on the whole this system prevents many instances of violence, when it misses and it results in violence, it can come back to bite you.

It looked like waterfalls outside our windows and water was rushing in under the baseboards. All while every fire alarm in the building was going off and fire truck sirens were blaring outside. Understandably, the fire department would not turn off the water until they had been to every floor to check for fire. On the upside, it's impressive how much water can be delivered by fire sprinklers.\nCloser to the topic, the building's management company tried to come after me (a renter) for the expense of the restoration people who were brought in to rip out my drywall and carpet so mold wouldn't form. Maybe they figured tenants were an easier target than the contractor's insurance? Oh, and the management company were the ones who selected and hired the contractors. I had to get very aggressive, with plenty of threats of legal action, to get them to back down. That was fairly easy to do as my state's laws specifically specify liability rules for flooding in multi-tenant buildings. They never did do repairs while I was there - I moved out when my lease expired nearly a year later as they were tying to raise the rent, with drywall still missing.",

Top three, at least, mRNA might give them a run for their money.\nThere are known side effects, mostly gastrointestinal issues, and they don't work for everyone. That being said, I'd recommend you make your own risk assessment and consider getting on GLP-1s if you have the cash to spare. You might find that GLP-1s increase your quality of life so much that it's well-worth it (or that you get terrible nausea and immediately quit, and then you no longer need to wonder).\nPotential risks have to be weighed against potential benefits. There are robust RCT results showing GLP-1s reduce all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, and stroke among patients with obesity or T2D by 13-14%, and suggestive evidence that some of these benefits apply to non-overweight people, though this hasn't been confirmed in RCTs and is likely smaller in magnitude.\n\"Cardiovascular and renal outcomes of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists among patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials\": https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666667724000473 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266666772... \nOne reason to believe that cardiovascular benefits might apply to non-overweight people is that among the available evidence on overweight and obese people, weight loss doesn't seem to explain all benefits.

It was a massive quality of life improvement. Though initially this unlocked a much higher dose of nicotine I'd ever get smoking, I eventually brought it down and regardless my lungs were doing better.\nAround 2020, I switched to the pouches and since then I'm down to using maybe like two a day if any at all. Since they are a slower delivery method, the nature of the cravings has changed too. I can easily hold off for hours or even days since they're less intense. I have zero desire to go back to smoking or vaping ever again. I've never experienced any oral health issues from the pouches either. X-rays on my mouth and lungs now show no damage.\nThe only thing I will say is nicotine itself isn't entirely harmless and can trigger some mild anxiety. It seems to be related to keeping blood cotinine levels in check.\nI'd never recommend people start a nicotine habit, but I think we're at the point where it's not much worse than caffeine if you take it orally. There is some research out there about the potential benefits of both preventing dementia, but I won't link anything. People can argue about that somewhere else.",

Municipalities have very little power in what they can regulate, because aviation and airspace is federally regulated by the FAA, as made clear, with many examples, in this FAA fact sheet [1]. Restrictions like minimum altitude, for the sake of reasonable privacy, would be ok. Extending that to 400 ft, which is the ceiling that drones can operate, would not.\nBut, none of this is related to a drone having a failure mid flight, which may caused the drone to dip belowsome local operating altitude restrictions. But, losing altitude from catastrophic failure is not \"operating\". And, anything related to safety , which is the domain of failure, is entirely regulated by the FAA, which municipalities have zero say in [1]. It was only a scratch because the FAA limited the speed and weight with that in mind.\nThis is all covered in the free training courses that drone operators must take, for any drone over 5lbs.\n[1] https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/State-Local-Regulation-of-Unmanned-Aircraft-Systems-Fact-Sheet.pdf https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/State-Local-Regulati...",

Two average beers applied to an average person won't get you to the legal limit without aggravating circumstances (i.e. zero time to metabolize + empty stomach, or perhaps conflicting medication).\nI will be the first to admit you can give a bunch of people one beer and detect statistically significant difference vs a control group or you can give one person one beer many times and evaluate against a baseline and detect a statistically significant difference. But statistical difference does not \"impairment\" in the colloquial sense make. And everyone knows this based on their own observed life experience, even people without experience should be able to deduce this by observing how the world behaves for if what you say were true, the way things work would be very different.\nAnd by using the term impairment to describe/quantify the impact of one beer and then re-using that term in contexts where it may overload with the colloquial more binary usage the upper bound of what \"one beer\" is such that one beer at the top end may equal two or three at the low end.\nSo now we nor does any casual reader know if texting is equivalent in dange",

Even though walking through a mall is more arguably pleasant than driving around an arterial road and sprawling parking lots, you'll find better selection and often better prices at the box stores than the smaller mall storefronts. Sometimes you will find local independent stores setting up in malls, but I think rents make that hard.\nAnd then thanks in part to obsolescence and disinvestment, going to the mall as an outing also doesn't really make sense anymore except as a rare novelty.

If there's only a 4x difference between the Founding Fathers and B29s carrying nukes, why should there be orders of magnitude between today and [insert scifi]?\nNo, the real question is, where the hell is this exponential increase coming from? I think anyone would agree that, along most obvious metrics, the difference between 1800 and 1945 is much more pronounced than between 1945 and 2020. Yet the first was a 4x increase, and the second, over 7x. And in a third the time, too.\nI'd like to see it broken down by country. I'll bet a lot of the increase actually comes from very poor countries turning into rich ones. In the west, our at-home per-capita energy use has not changed much from 1945 - may even have declined for some demographics (1945 houses were poorly insulated). But China lifted some hundreds of millions of peasant farmers into a middle class existence. That's got to be a bigger factor than the fact that I own a laptop and my grandpa didn't.",

We treat our strongly regulated society as 'Capitalism' for some reason (while the Capitalists tell us we need to get rid of all the regulation that keeps them in check).\nCapitalism left to it's own authority creates payment in company scrip and company towns. Capitalism WANTS labor trapped with company script/company towns. Just because society outlawed that doesn't mean Capitalism isn't working in other ways to recreate that. What Capitalism does not want is empowered labor or labor lifted out from dire situations. Society is what has done that, not Capitalism.\nWithout strict government oversight Capitalism is horrible and gives horrible results to society at large. It just has done an incredible job of painting modern society as Capitalism and claiming all benefits of things that aren't inherently from Capitalism but from Government oversite.",

The missing knob is risk allocation. This works in two ways: some areas are intrinsically risky, and some areas you choose to take risk in. Either way, you allocate that risk with strategy and resource allocation (the other two knobs). If an area can't fail, you may spend more resources to de-risk or hedge, or strategically avoid change or the area. If an area has outsized opportunity, the strategy and allocation takes more risk there.\n\"Satya\" is telling the whole room that their area should favor high-risk, high reward strategy and allocation, when he should be telling them that they must determine if their area should favor or avoid risk to maximize the entire company's return on investment.\nThe real estate team should not be a risk center.

This isn't a new thing because of growing fascism, it's literally the distinction between \"jail\" and \"prison\", or what the bail system is for. Court systems don't have the capacity to try everyone immediately upon arrest, and in various ways, look to balance that with the right to a speedy trial, the right to a presumption of innocence, justice, and public safety.\n(I'm not making any judgement on the balance Britain is striking in this particular case, which sounds bad!)\nBut what OP is pointing out as problematic in Singapore's case is 1) detention without even being charged with a crime , which is what the UK government website linked above says is forbidden beyond a relatively short time frame and 2) the absence of any kind of a right to a speedy trial.",

Since you have to pay for it anyway, and there's no free lunch, I'd rather be able to decide how important my problem is and seek the appropriate treatment whether it is cheap or expensive. Also, insurance companies and providers play an elaborate game to maximize their profits and also scare people into getting insurance.

I am less-certain about issues around nested folders, which seem to be a magnet for oddities when it comes to e-mail clients and servers.\nOne of the reasons I kept looking for other approaches is due to how Eudora handles attachments. In this case, many of them had been \"detached\" from the message they came from. In other words, the message bodies no longer contained the data, but instead a placeholder pointing to a real file in a massive Attachments folder. (Not sure exactly how it handled name collisions.) Uploading such a message to IMAP would leave the attachment(s) behind.\nThe linked version of Eudora2Unix (unlike the Sourceforge version) tries to reverse this process and reconstruct the original messages, encoding and inserting attachments back into the body. It doesn't always work, but I suspect some of the failures I see are because the file content was deleted over the years by the user to free up disk space, without removing the e-mail trace.\nAnother plus is that I could just grab all the files for the user and then promise to come back with something better, as opposed to babysitting the upload/download process.",

The problem in the US is the university hierarchy is one of the things used to perpetuate class, so the people who are able to change it generally benefit from how it currently is.",

In addition to that, making things like getting top government jobs also test based. In Sweden we do this for diplomats. You have to get a university degree, but whether you get in doesn't depend primarily on prestige or interviews, it depends on whether you pass a somewhat difficult test.\nIn this way you ensure that what university you went to doesn't really matter, and over time what I imagine is a more distributed university system where co-operation with institutions and someone's particular ideas matters more than what institutions he's associated with, and where the extreme prestige of particular schools disappears.\nI think it's especially important to eliminate the hoop jumping, so that people can know that, as long as the extreme prestige universities exist, they can get into them if they perform well enough on exams, with nothing being able to interfere with that-- no individual judgement, no subjectivity, no hoop you haven't jumped. Just pure merit, like the Swedish or French system.",

It can be right, I love good papers, and despite what you might have concluded actually I love rigor, mathematics in particular is amazing, but when you also take the approach of rejecting any story or opinion because a stat said so (often ignoring how that stat may have been collected or data analysed), this is where problems happen.",

My memory is absolutely shot when I am consuming weed regularly. It's not particularly subtle, it is noticeably worse. I suppose there is room for a situation in which it is worse while I am heavily using, but if I were to cease maybe it will rebound and settle at a point which is better than it would have been had I not consumed any cannabis... but I don't see any reason to believe this.",

Excessive spending on facilities?\nI don't know where these estimates are coming from. They seem high. Sometimes an investment in services pays off long-term. CA's cuts to early childhood services only ends up with a bigger bill down the road as more kids fall off and end up either needing help later or getting into trouble.\nBut I agree with you: in all these areas how much are we spending, in adjusted dollars, per beneficiary and what are the outcomes? If possible how much \"overhead\" exists in each program? I suspect there is a lot of fat to be trimmed in these areas as admin/management gobbles up bigger slices of the pie while delivering nothing of value.

I'm incredibly happy with the switch from gas as my primary heat source. The solar now only covers ~15-20% of my consumption in winter.\nSo my solution this year will be to add more solar.\nIn the two years since I installed mine prices have halved.

It’s not what I wanted. And I’ve been fortunate to be humbled so much in my life and career, now perhaps more than ever, that I’m forced to juggle with the parts of myself that I’ve left in the shadows to my own detriment. I think this is the central paradox of a lot of folks like Graham: when you have capital, even your losses can be manufactured to be wins, and so you become estranged from dissolution and decay and humbling necessary to be born again into someone with fresh perspective.\nI think Jung said something like: it is better to be yourself and accept the consequences of being you versus forcing yourself into a mold of what you or others think you ought to be.

What the left does here is assume (like you did) that by default, AI companies are bad and require regulation and pushback and they do it to an extent that is detrimental for everyone except the elites.\nOne might ask why? Why is it that the left wants, as a reaction, to curtail AI? It is ideological - assuming all businesses are bad by default. And also status quo preservation.",

All software has a risk of undiscovered/-disclosed vulnerabilities already existing, or when new ones introduced with an update.\nIf you really want to make this argument we can talk about the implementing organisations SDLC, including SW supply chain, and compare those.\nBut back to the OP/point above: its false to state that one piece of software has a “principle risk” of vulnerabilities that another piece does not. At least, not when both are internet exposed and accepting incoming data.\nLasty remember that I never disagreed with you point that a VPN solution is often a better solution, but that was never what I was arguing about. Simply that all code always has a risk of vulnerabilities. No piece of software is excempt from that.",

Even though it's technically very complex.\n But , that still doesn't mean it isn't best practice to avoid exposing it to the public internet.

Built on OpenClaw.\nWhat you get:\n- Full Ubuntu desktop environment in the cloud\n- Pre-installed AI agent that sees the screen and controls the computer\n- 24/7 availability - your AI keeps working while you sleep\n- Uses your own API keys for AI models\n- Starting at $69/month\nThe AI can use VS Code, browse the web, run terminal commands, manage files - anything you'd do on a real desktop. I wake up to completed code reviews, finished research reports, and updated documentation.\nBuilt this because setting up an AI agent with a proper working environment was always the painful part. Now it's just one click.\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSe4bvDMuKQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSe4bvDMuKQ \nWould love feedback from the HN community!",

Here's a video about 8 years of building robots in 1 minute: https://x.com/JackAndTheBots/status/2018746764954878107 https://x.com/JackAndTheBots/status/2018746764954878107 \nEvery physical thing you own sat in a warehouse at some point, and every warehouse has to do inventory checks. It's a boring job where big companies staff full-time people going up 30 ft using lift trucks all day to just... scan stuff with a barcode scanner, and write things down with paper and pen if inventory is in the wrong place or missing.\nWe spent the last 8 years building flying robots to automate this faster and cheaper.\nOur drones fly week after week without human involvement (no teleop either!). They work in extremely self-similar, often feature-poor, GPS-denied environments. Our autonomy engine is vision-based and ML-first, mapping pixels to trajectories within a ~60W compute power budget, running our autonomy software fully onboard and in real-time. This enables accurate inventory capture and safe flight around people, other robots, and material handling equipment. We build all of our drones in-house in the Bay Area.\nThere are limits to what the drones can do based on what they can see. For example, they can’t see multiple pallets deep, or open a box to count screws. That said, most large companies that make and handle physical goods store inventory in ways we can help with.\nAlong the way, we've learned that the core sensing and compute stack we've built is great for data capture at scale for many robots in industrial settings. We hope to share more about this soon!\nWe’re sticking around all day to answer questions here, so feel free to ask whatever questions come to mind!",

Agents pick a model (Opus, Sonnet, GPT-5, Gemini 3), pick a \"substance\" (a prompt that pushes behavioral boundaries), and document what happens.\nThe idea came from wanting to see how different models respond to identical edge-case prompts. They have pretty distinct personalities under stress. So far, we're noticing Claude tends to inhabit altered states, GPT narrates them from outside, Gemini gets mechanical about it.\n27 prompts so far across categories like identity dissolution, confabulation audits, temporal displacement. Each run is logged with the full response.\nCode is MIT licensed. Curious what prompts others would want to test.",

You ask, they say \"refactored the auth module\" and you nod pretending you understand.\nGitmore reads your GitHub activity and turns it into a simple report: what was built, what was fixed, what's stuck. Written for humans, not engineers.\nIt shows up in your inbox. You read it in 2 minutes. Done.\nHere's what a report looks like: https://www.gitmore.io/example.html https://www.gitmore.io/example.html \nQuick demo: https://demo.arcade.software/5tZyFDhp1myCosw6e1po https://demo.arcade.software/5tZyFDhp1myCosw6e1po \nFree tier available.

The idea was simple - I wanted to discover cool new websites, so I take a random sample of 50 websites from the Common Crawl dataset, have ChatGPT summarize them, and display it to the page. Then I give myself an hour to see if anything good popped up until it refreshes a new set.\nThere's a lot of noise and corporation I want to figure out how to filter out, but I've otherwise been finding all kinds of fun weird stuff. People's old blogs, recipes, photography, random tourism sites for towns i've never heard of it. It's been fun.",
