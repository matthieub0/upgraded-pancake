      "body_text": "Hey HN! I'm Rodrigo, I run distributed systems across a few countries. I built Openfuse because of something that kept bugging me about how we all do circuit breakers.\nIf you're running 20 instances of a service and Stripe starts returning 500s, each instance discovers that independently. Instance 1 trips its breaker after 5 failures. Instance 14 just got recycled and hasn't seen any yet. Instance 7 is in half-open, probing a service you already know is dead. For some window of time, part of your fleet is protecting itself and part of it is still hammering a dead dependency and timing out, and all you can do is watch.\nLibraries can't fix this. Opossum, Resilience4j, Polly are great at the pattern, but they make per-instance decisions with per-instance state. Your circuit breakers don't talk to each other.\nOpenfuse is a centralized control plane. It aggregates failure metrics from every instance in your fleet and makes the trip decision based on the full picture. When the breaker opens, every instance knows at the same time.\nIt's a few lines of code:\n const result = await openfuse.breaker('stripe').protect(\n () => chargeCustomer(payload)\n );\n \nThe SDK is open source, anyone can see exactly what runs inside their services.\nThe other thing I couldn't let go of: when you get paged at 3am, you shouldn't have to find logs across 15 services to figure out what's broken. Openfuse gives you one dashboard showing every breaker state across your fleet: what's healthy, what's degraded, what tripped and when.\nAnd, you shouldn't need a deploy to act. You can open a breaker from the dashboard and every instance stops calling that dependency immediately. Planned maintenance window at 3am? Open beforehand. Fix confirmed? Close it instantly. Thresholds need adjusting? Change them in the dashboard, takes effect across your fleet in seconds. No PRs, no CI, no config files.\nIt has a decent free tier for trying it out, then $99/mo for most teams, $399/mo with higher throughput and some enterprise features. Solo founder, early stage, being upfront.\nWould love to hear from people who've fought cascading failures in production. What am I missing?",

          "text": "This is incredibly generous context... thank you. A few of these hit close to problems I'm thinking about.\nThe Decider pattern you're describing (reading keys from memcache to decide behavior at runtime) is essentially what Openfuse is trying to productize. A centralized place that tells your fleet how to behave, without each process figuring it out independently. So it's validating to hear that's where Twitter landed organically.\nOn the PM2 point: you're right, holding a connection per process doesn't scale well at that huge scale. A local sidecar that receives state updates and exposes them via socket or shared memory to sibling processes is a much better model at that density. That's not how it works today, each process holds its own connection, but your framing is exactly how I'd want to evolve it. However, I can't say that is in the short-term goals for now, need to validate the product first and add some important features + publish the self hosted version.\nOn the dogpile: the half-open state is where this matters most. When a breaker opens and then transitions to half-open, you don't want 50 instances all sending probe requests simultaneously. The coalescing pattern you're describing from DataLoader is a neat way of solving it, I wonder if I can implement this somehow without adding a service/proxy closer to the clients just for that.\nOn failure modes: agreed, \"service is down\" is the simplest case.

We used to say that all of your \"Unix Friends\" fail at scale and act differently.\nI once had 3000 machines running NTP sync'd cronjobs on the exact same second pounding the upstream server and causing outages (Whoops, add random offsets to cron!)\nThis sort of \"dogpile effect\" exists when fetching keys as well. A key drops out of cache and 30 machines (or worker threads) trying to load the same key at the same time, because the cache is empty.\nOne of the solutions around this problem was Facebook's Dataloader ( https://github.com/graphql/dataloader https://github.com/graphql/dataloader ), which tries to intercept the request pipeline, batch the requests together and coalesce many requests into one.\nEssentially DataLoader will coalesce all individual loads which occur within a single frame of execution (a single tick of the event loop) and then call your batch function with all requested keys.\nIt helps by reducing requests and offering something resembling backpressure by moving the request into one code path.\nI would expect that you'd have the same sort of problem at scale with this system given the number of requests on many procs across many machines.\nWe had a lot of small tricks like this (they add up!), in some cases we'd insert a message queue inbetween the requestor and the service so that we could increase l",

If you have proper timeouts and circuit breakers in your service this shouldn't really matter. This solution will save a few hundred requests, but I don't think this really matters. If this is a pain point its easier to adjust the circuit-breaker settings (reduce the error rate, increase the window, ...) than introduce a whole new level of complexity.\n> Curious how you handle the recovery side\nWe have a feature flag provider built in-house. But it doesn't support this use-case, so what we done is to create flag where we put the % value we want to bring back and handle the logic inside the service. Example: if you want to bring back 6,25% (1/16) of our users this means we should switch back every user that has an account-id ending in 'a'. For 12.5% (2/16) we want users with account-id ending either in 'a' or 'b'. This is a pretty hacky solution, but it solves our problem when we need to transition from our fallback to our main flow.",

          "text": "You're right, for intra-cluster calls where failures are scoped between the node itself and the infra around it, per-instance breakers are what you want. I wouldn't suggest centralizing those, and I might be wrong, but in most of these scenarios there is no fallback anyways (maybe except Redis?)\nOpenfuse is aimed at the other case: shared external dependencies where 15 services all call the same dependency and each one is independently discovering the same outage at different times. Different failure modes, different coordination needs, and you have no way to manually intervene or even just see what's open. Think of your house: every appliance has its own protection system, but that doesn't exempt you from having the distribution board.\nYou can also put it between your service/monolith and your own other services, e.g. if a recommendations engine, or a loyalty system in an E-Commerce or POS softwares go down, all hotpath flows from all other services will just bypass their calls to it. So with \"external\" I mean another service, whether it's yours or from a vendor.\nOn the feature flag point: that's interesting because you're essentially describing the pain of building circuit breaker behavior on top of feature flag infrastructure. The \"switching back\" problem you mention is exactly what half-open state solves: controlled probe requests that test recovery automatically and restore traffic gradually, without someone manually flipping a flag and hoping.\nThat's the gap between \"we",

You seems to be assuming that people use circuit-breaks only on external requests, in this situation your approach seems reasonable.\nIf you have cbs between every service call your model doesn't seem a good idea. Where I work every network call is behind a cb (external services, downstream services, database, redis, s3, ...) and it's pretty common to see failures isolated in a single k8s node. In this situation we want to have independent cbs, they can open independently.\nYour take on observability/operation seems interesting but it is pretty close to feature flags. And that is exactly how we handle these scenarios, we have a couple of feature flags we can enable to switch traffic around during outages.

When I left, I no longer had access to the sending data I'd spent years learning from, billions of sent emails, deliverability patterns, things that actually move email engagement\nCos' I don't have this data anymore, I built the best thing I could to help with the email marketing I currently do:\n---\nmy research process\nMultiple sprints across all major email marketing topics. The crawler pulled 908 sources: Litmus, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Campaign Monitor, and Salesforce annual reports; practitioner blogs; academic research; platform documentation; Reddit threads; Shopify forums; and community discussions on X. From those, I extracted 4,798 discrete insights. Every claim that made it into the guide has a source. Anything that was unsourced opinion got cut.\nThat produced EMB v4: Over 80k words across 16 chapters. After two editorial passes, cutting duplicates, consolidating overlapping sections, removing anything that didn't earn its place it landed at 55,000 words. I reached out to all the email experts cited for their feedback too, over half contributed and made changes. I was stoked with that.\n---\nthe skill vs bible issue\nThe full 55K-word guide is too big for a context window. You can't just point Claude at the whole thing and expect coherent answers.\nSo the SKILL.md is a separate, condensed extraction: the key frameworks, benchmarks, practitioner names, and tactical thresholds that fit in context. When you ask Claude a question with the skill installed, it's drawing on a structured summary rather than trying to retrieve from a raw document dump.\nbut this creates a problem not solved yet: the skill and the Bible can drift. As the Bible gets updated (experts send corrections, better data emerges), the skill needs to be manually kept in sync. The obvious fix is an MCP server that connects them so changes to the Bible automatically propagate to the skill. I'll probably build that with the next big update to the bible.\n---\nthe data gap\nI saw on smartmail that occasionally \"conversion wisdom\" or email best practise would actually not line up with our real, aggregate sending data. Eg \"best time of the week to send a newsletter is 9am tue/thurs\". Nope. Was absolutely a case by case solution and the rule of thumb here would often hurt email engagement. \nSo, the weakness of this project is it's built on published research, not proprietary sending data. Published benchmarks are backward-looking, aggregated across wildly different use cases, and often produced by ESPs with an incentive to make email look good.\nWhat I'd really want is anonymised send-level data from real campaigns. Subject line → open rate, across list sizes, industries, send times. Body structure → click rate. Flow configuration → revenue per recipient.\nIf anyone is working on this or has access to send-level data and wants to contribute, I'm very interested.\n---\nthe ESP integration problem\nThe other thing ",

      "body_text": "OneRingAI started as the internal engine of an enterprise agentic platform we've been building for 2+ years. After watching customers hit the same walls with auth, vendor lock-in, and context management over and over, we extracted the core into a standalone open-source library.\nThe two main alternatives didn't fit what we needed in production:\n- LangChain: Great ecosystem, but the abstraction layers kept growing. By the time you wire up chains, runnables, callbacks, and agents across 50+ packages, you're fighting the framework\n more than building your product.\n- CrewAI: Clean API, but Python-only and the role-based metaphor breaks down when you need fine-grained control over auth, context windows, or tool failures.\nOneRingAI is a single TypeScript library (~62K LOC, 20 deps) that treats the boring production problems as first-class concerns:\nAuth as architecture, not afterthought. A centralized connector registry with built-in OAuth (4 flows, AES-256-GCM storage, 43 vendor templates). This came directly from dealing with\nenterprise SSO and multi-tenant token isolation — no more scattered env vars or rolling your own token refresh.\nPer-tool circuit breakers. One flaky Jira API shouldn't crash your entire agent loop. Each tool and connector gets independent failure isolation with retry/backoff. We learned this the\nhard way running agents against dozens of customer SaaS integrations simultaneously.\nContext that doesn't blow up. Plugin-based context management with token budgeting. InContextMemory puts frequently-accessed state directly in the prompt instead of requiring a retrieval\ncall. Compaction removes tool call/result pairs together so the LLM never sees orphaned context.\nActually multi-vendor. 12 LLM providers native, 36 models in a typed registry with pricing and feature flags. Switch vendors by changing a connector name. Run openai-prod and\nopenai-backup side by side. Enterprise customers kept asking for this — nobody wants to be locked into one provider.\nMulti-modal built in. Image gen (DALL-E 3, gpt-image-1, Imagen 4), video gen (Sora 2, Veo 3), TTS, STT — all in the same library. No extra packages.\nNative MCP support with a registry pattern for managing multiple servers, health checks, and auto tool format conversion.\nWhat it's not: it's not a no-code agent builder, and it's not trying to be a framework for every possible AI use case. It's an opinionated library for people building production agent\nsystems in TypeScript who want auth, resilience, and multi-vendor support without duct-taping 15 packages together.\n2,285 tests, strict TypeScript throughout. The API surface is small on purpose — Connector.create(), Agent.create(), agent.run().\nWe also built Hosea, an open-source Electron desktop app on top of OneRingAI, if you want to see what a full agent system looks like in practice rather than just reading docs.\nGitHub: https://github.com/Integrail/oneringai https://github.com/Integrail/oneringai \nnpm: npm i @everworker/oneringai\nComparis",

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nAfter roughly 8 years of silently rolling 1.1 nightlies, we finally tagged a proper stable 2.0 release.\nWe built this because wrist-sized Linux is genuinely fun to hack on, and because a handful of us think it's worth keeping capable hardware alive long after manufacturers move on. Smartwatches don't really get old — the silicon is basically the same as it was a decade ago. We just keep making it useful for us.\nNo usage stats, no tracking, no illusions of mass adoption. The only real signal we get is the occasional person who appears in our Matrix chat going \"hey, it booted on my watch from 2014 and now it's usable again\" — and that's plenty.\nPrivacy is non-negotiable: zero telemetry, no cloud, full local control. Longevity is the other half: we refuse to let good hardware become e-waste just because support ended.\nOn the learning side, it's been one of the best playgrounds: instant feedback on your wrist makes QML/Qt, JavaScript watchfaces and embedded Linux feel tangible. The community is small and kind — perfect for people who want to learn open-source dev without gatekeeping.\nTechnically we're still pragmatic: libhybris + older kernels on most devices since it just works, but we've already mainlined rinato (Samsung Gear 2) and sparrow (ASUS ZenWatch 2) — rinato even boots with a usable UI. That's the direction we're pushing toward.\nRepo: https://github.com/AsteroidOS https://github.com/AsteroidOS \nInstall images & docs: https://asteroidos.org https://asteroidos.org \n2.0 demo video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc \nAnnouncement post: https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/ https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/ \nQuestions, port requests, mentoring offers, criticism, weird ideas — all welcome. We do this because shaping a tiny, open wearable UX and infrastructure is oddly satisfying, and because Linux on the wrist still feels like a playground worth playing in.\nCheers, the AsteroidOS Team",

Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.\nWhat it does:\n- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.\n- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.\n- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.\n- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.\n- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.\n- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.\n- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.\n- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.\n- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.\nTech details for the curious:\nThe whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files. It uses the modern @Observable macro (not the old ObservableObject/Published pattern), structured concurrency with async/await and withThrowingTaskGroup for concurrent batch fetching, and SwiftUI throughout — no UIKit/AppKit bridges except for the WKWebView wrapper via NSViewRepresentable.\nTwo APIs power the data: the official HN Firebase API for individual item/user fetches, and the Algolia Search API for feeds, filtering, and search. The Algolia API is surprisingly powerful for this — it lets you do date-range filtering, pagination, and full-text search that the Firebase API doesn't support.\nCI/CD:\nThe release pipeline is a single GitHub Actions workflow (467 lines) that handles the full macOS distribution story: build and archive, code sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple (with a 5-retry staple loop for t",

      "body_text": "I run a lot of Claude Code and Codex sessions in parallel. I was using Ghostty with a bunch of split panes, and relying on native macOS notifications to know when an agent needed me. But Claude Code's notification body is always just \"Claude is waiting for your input\" with no context, and with enough tabs open, I couldn't even read the titles anymore.\nI tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, colors, and more.\nThe main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (cmux notify) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.\nThe in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from agent-browser [1]. Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, evaluate JS, and read console logs. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.\nEverything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API – create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-WxO5YUTOs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-WxO5YUTOs \nRepo (AGPL): https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux \n[1] https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser",

I'll say that, while I love Tauri, using Electrobun has been an absolute breeze. I got the same app done in roughly 70% of the time [2]. It's a very productive stack. In no small part due to Electrobun, but also the fact that Bun has tons of DX niceties and a builtin bundler.\nElectrobun lets you open/manipulate/close webview windows and communicate with them using typed rpc. It also handles building, code signing, and notarization.\nAnd because I'm using Bun, running an HMR + React + Tailwind server is just one command (`bun ./index.html`) or like 5 lines of code. Pass --console and the webview's console.log()s get streamed to your Terminal too.\nThere's tons of other things Electrobun does that I haven't even mentioned, because I haven't interacted much with them yet. E.g. I know that it lets you show platform-native notifications, prompts/popups, etc.\nThere also is a very impressive updating mechanism that relies on a bsdiff implementation written in Zig. You just ship the deltas, so updates to very large apps are just a few KBs most of the time.\nIt's genuinely a very productive stack and impressive piece of tech.\n[1] Not affiliated - I just like the project.\n[2]: The API and implementation was clear, so I'll cautiously say this is not a case of \"rewrites are always faster\". In fact, the Tauri version was a rewrite too :)",

Electron values the app developer, wants to give them assurances that the chromium is the exact specified chromium version, and bundles it. I get it, the world is complex and clamping down is a natural response, but this conservatism has given Electron its deservedly bad reputation, and Tauri's slightly shifted stance alleviates so much pain.",

      "body_text": "I've been working on creating a Low Power FM radio station for the east San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. We are not yet on the broadcast band but our channel will be 95.9FM and our range can been seen on the homepage of our site.\nKPBJ is a freeform community radio station. Anyone in the area is encouraged to get a timeslot and become a host. We make no curatorial decisions. Its sort of like public access or a college station in that way.\nThis month we launched our internet stream and on-boarded about 60 shows. They are mostly music but there are a few talk shows. We are restricting all shows to monthly time slots for now but this will change in the near future as everyone gets more familiar with the systems involved.\nAll shows are pre-recorded until we can raise the money to get a studio.\nWe have a site secured for our transmitter but we need to fundraise to cover the equipment and build out costs. We will be broadcasting with 100W ERP from a ridgeline in the Verdugos at about 1500ft elevation. The site will need to be off grid so we will need to install a solar system with battery backup. We are planning to sync the station to the transmit site with 802.11ah.\nI've built all of our web infrastructure using Haskell, NixOS, Terraform, and HTMX: https://github.com/solomon-b/kpbj.fm https://github.com/solomon-b/kpbj.fm \nThis is a pretty substantial project involving a bunch of social and technical challenges and a shoe string budget. I'm feel pretty confident we will pull it off and make it a high impact local radio station.\nThe station is managed by a 501c3 non-profit we created. We are actively seeking fundraising, especially to get our transmit site up and running. If you live in the area or want to contribute in any way then please reach out!",

It wasn't cryptographically strong protection, but it was practical for commercial distribution.\nThe key insight wasn't removing power -- it was modularizing it so commercial distribution and deep editability could coexist.\nHyperLook took a different approach by making the user interface editor a separate removable object, and not shipping it with runtime products, so you could remove the editor of any stack, or even replace it with a different style of editor.\nThe other difference was that HyperLook's entire user interface (its popup dialogs, editors, and property sheets) was all made out of editable HyperLook Stacks -- unlike HyperCard, which used uneditable Mac UIs for editors and dialogs.

For example, in the Swiss Public Transit playground[1], you can edit the fetch instructions to access transport data from a different place –of course it would need some tweaks to suit the structure coming from the different API–, then the project can be forked to be independently used live in the Breadboard environment or published.\nAt the moment, the functionality to make a user project openly shareable as a playground is not available yet, but I think this effectively blur the line between the user and the developer.\n[0] https://app.breadboards.io/playgrounds/weather https://app.breadboards.io/playgrounds/weather \n[1] https://app.breadboards.io/playgrounds/public_transit https://app.breadboards.io/playgrounds/public_transit",

By responsive I mean (1) they respond to @media prefers-color-scheme(dark) (2) they change their look based on size. SVG supports this using CSS. (1) is more important for me.\nCurrently I have to spit out SVG and manually edit. If I decide to change the original in whatever tool I'm using then I have to manually edit again which is painful. For example, I have to go find every shape I want to change color by hand and then adjust its attributes",

It spawns its own WiFi hotspot and serves a web UI — connect from any device and you have a portable RF signal generator with 12 transmission modes: FM broadcasting with RDS, FT8, RTTY, FSK, POCSAG paging, Morse code, SSTV image transmission, voice cloning via live mic, spectrum painting, IQ replay, carrier wave, and frequency sweeps.\nEverything runs through a browser interface. Upload audio files, type messages, configure frequencies, and transmit. The Pi's GPIO pin does the actual RF generation via rpitx — no external radio hardware needed.\nWritten in Go with a real-time WebSocket frontend. Includes a preset system, playlist builder, and multi-device support (connect multiple phones/laptops to the AP and share control).\nWithout an antenna the signal barely reaches 5 meters, which makes it perfect for indoor experimentation and learning about RF protocols without causing interference. All my testing was done indoors with no antenna attached.\nBuilt this because I wanted a single portable tool to experiment with every common RF transmission mode without hauling around expensive SDR equipment.\nPre-built SD card image available if you want to skip the build process.\nGitHub: https://github.com/psyb0t/piraterf https://github.com/psyb0t/piraterf \nBlog post: https://ciprian.51k.eu/piraterf-turning-a-20-raspberry-pi-zero-into-an-rf-tx-swiss-army-knife/ https://ciprian.51k.eu/piraterf-turning-a-20-raspberry-pi-ze...",

      "body_text": "Hi HN. I am a programmer from Japan who loves Emacs. I am building elecxzy. It is a free (zero-cost), lightweight, Emacs-like text editor for Windows.\nI designed it to be comfortable and ready to use immediately, without a custom init.el. Here is a quick overview:\n- Provides mouse-free operation and classic Emacs keybindings for essential tasks (file I/O, search, split windows, syntax highlighting).\n- Drops the Lisp execution engine entirely. This keeps startup and operation lightweight.\n- Solves CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) IME control issues natively on Windows.\nI never managed to learn Lisp. I just copy-pasted snippets to maintain my init.el. However, I loved the Emacs keybindings. I loved operating an editor entirely without a mouse. I wanted an editor I could just open and use immediately. Also, standard Emacs binaries for Windows often have subtle usability issues for CJK users.\nSo, I thought about whether I could build an Emacs-like text editor using Electron, the same framework as VS Code.\nBuilding an editor inside a browser engine required thinking a lot about what NOT to build. To make it feel native, I had to navigate DOM limitations. I learned that intentionally dropping complex features improves rendering speed. For example, I skipped implementing \"word wrap.\" For syntax highlighting, I did not use a full AST parser. Instead, I used strict \"line-by-line\" parsing. The highlight colors for multi-line comments are occasionally incorrect, but it is practically unproblematic and keeps the editor fast.\nUnder the hood, to bypass browser limitations and handle large files smoothly, I implemented a virtual rendering (virtual scrolling) system. For text management and Undo/Redo, I use a custom Piece Table. I built a custom KeyResolver for Emacs chords. I also used koffi to call Win32 APIs directly for precise IME control.\nI respect Windows Notepad as one of the most widely used text editors. However, in my daily work or coding tasks, I often felt it lacked certain features. On the other hand, I found VS Code too heavy just to write a quick memo. Even with extensions, it never quite gave me that native Emacs flow. I do not want to replace Notepad, VS Code, or Emacs. If users want rich extensions and heavy customization, I believe they should use Emacs or VS Code. My goal is to fill the gap between them—to build a \"greatest common denominator\" editor for people who just want an Emacs-like environment on Windows without the setup.\nIt is still in alpha (so it might not work perfectly), but you can test it on Windows by downloading the zip from the GitHub releases, extracting it, and running elecxzy.exe. For screenshots, basic usage, and keybindings, please check the README on the GitHub project page.\nI am looking for feedback: Is there a demand for a zero-config, Lisp-free, \"Notepad-like\" Emacs-style editor? What are the minimum standard features required to make it useful? I would love to hear your technical insights.",

I know the \"start once and use emacsclient\" workflow is the standard and most efficient way for Emacs users, but I personally tend to open and close editor windows frequently, just like using a simple notepad.\nRegarding the Lisp part, I completely agree with you. As I mentioned in other threads, if you remove Lisp, it is absolutely not Emacs anymore.\nI am not trying to build a true Emacs, nor am I trying to deny its great philosophy. I just deeply love the physical typing experience and muscle memory of Emacs keybindings. My goal was simply to extract that specific UX and package it into a standalone app that I could run immediately without any setup.\nSo you are right—it is just a personal project to recreate the typing feel I love, rather than an Emacs replacement!",

The lightweight binary you mentioned is likely emacsclient, which is indeed a good way to use a running Emacs process as a quick editor.\nYou are right that if elecxzy were just for editing a single file, it might not offer much over a standard Notepad. However, the real value I wanted to achieve is the ability to view, edit, and integrate multiple sources using muscle memory, without touching the mouse.\nWhile it runs as a simple standalone window, it supports Emacs window splitting commands like C-x 2, C-x 3, and C-x 1.\nHere is a quick video I posted a while ago (the text is in Japanese, but you can see the window splitting in action):\n https://x.com/elecxzy/status/2020370174818631769 https://x.com/elecxzy/status/2020370174818631769 \nAs for contributing to the upstream Emacs to fix CJK issues, I agree that it would be a more impactful approach for the community.

I completely agree with your point—the true power of Emacs lies in its Lisp environment and infinite customizability.\nIf my goal was to build a true successor or alternative to Emacs, dropping Lisp and using Electron would indeed be a completely wrong approach.\nHowever, my goal was much simpler and narrower. I wanted a zero-setup, standalone notepad that natively supports Emacs' complex prefix keybindings (like C-x 2 to split windows or C-x b to switch buffers) right out of the box. While simple keys like C-n or C-f can be easily configured in most modern editors, perfectly replicating the sequence and feel of prefix keys usually requires installing plugins and writing complex configurations.\nAdditionally, as I mentioned in another thread, using web technologies allowed me to solve the Japanese IME cursor tracking issues on Windows natively.\nSo you are absolutely right: this project misses the core philosophy of what makes Emacs great.

Emacs is a product I deeply respect, but configuring it to handle Japanese input smoothly on Windows has always been a challenge for me.\nThere were two main pain points I desperately wanted to solve for my daily workflow:\n1. Prefix keys being swallowed by the IME:\nIn Windows Emacs, if your IME is ON and you try to split the window using C-x 2, the 2 (or full-width ２) gets captured by the IME. The command fails, meaning you constantly have to toggle the IME OFF just to run basic window or buffer commands.\nIn elecxzy, I implemented fine-grained control: when the editor enters a \"prefix state\" (like after pressing C-x or C-c), it actively prevents the IME from capturing the next keystroke. This allows you to smoothly execute commands like C-x 2 or C-x b even while the IME is left ON.\n2. IME User Experience (Positioning and Fonts):\nIn Windows Emacs, unless you apply specific patches or complex configurations, the IME candidate window often fails to appear right next to the text you are typing. Furthermore, the font used during IME composition often differs from the editor's main font. These details really hurt the overall typing UX.\nBy using Electron, elecxzy places an invisible <textarea> exactly at the virtual cursor's pixel position. This lets the browser engine handle the IME natively. The candidate window always tracks the cursor perfectly and the composition text seamlessly matches the ed",

I work with crypto and it seriously matters if I got owned in that I can lose amounts of money entrusted to me that I could never hope to recover or repay. I believe it is a basic fiduciary duty to use as much code as possible written in safer languages. Sublime Text is a massive C++ app and I can't look at the code. I am going to preferentially treat the Rust app as better. There's plenty of CVEs in editors. If I could I would replace every binary written in an unsafe language on every machine I ever use.\nMy editor touches every bit of infrastructure I have.

It started purely out of my curiosity as a software engineer.\nI use VS Code at work, and I just wanted to see what its underlying technology (Electron) was like to build with. Once I started playing with it, I realized it was a remarkably solid and flexible platform. That inspired me to try building something I had always wanted: a zero-setup, lightweight Emacs-like editor.\nAs a happy side-effect, using web technologies allowed me to use the Japanese IME without any stress, just like Windows Notepad. Unlike Windows Emacs, which sometimes requires special configurations, I was able to make it work just by running elecxzy.exe.\nSo while it lacks the beautiful Lisp ecosystem of true Emacs (like Lem), it started as a fun technical exploration that eventually became my daily driver!",

It runs locally, no account, no tracking, no ads.\nUnder the hood it's a custom synthesizer driven by sentence embeddings, not a generative AI model (although you can choose to use one!) — so there's no GPU, no API calls, and it starts playing almost instantly. The whole thing is open source: https://github.com/prabal-rje/latentscore https://github.com/prabal-rje/latentscore \nIf you're a developer and want to use it programmatically it's also a Python library - pip install latentscore — one line to render audio. But honestly I just use the web player myself when I'm working.\nFair warning: it's still alpha and the synth has limits, so please don't expect full songs or vocals. It's ambient/procedural only.

That's the trade-off we make for performance.\n However, to address your point about \"sane wrappers\" and concurrency models: I actually implemented Go-style Channels (CSP) on top of this scheduler to bridge that gap.\n It uses co_await to mimic Go's channel behavior, supporting Direct Handoff (skipping the buffer/queue if a receiver is waiting) and optimization via await_suspend returning false to avoid context switches on the fast path.\n While a full-blown STM might be too heavy, I found that combining these Channels with Epoch-Based Reclamation (EBR) gives a pretty robust safety net without the overhead of heavy locking.\n If you're interested, the Channel implementation is here: https://github.com/lixiasky-back/tiny_coro-build_your_own_MN_scheduler/blob/main/include%2Fchannel.h#L1-L180 https://github.com/lixiasky-back/tiny_coro-build_your_own_MN...",

Malicious agents can impersonate others, and skill/plugin marketplaces have no auth layer. Cisco's security team already found data exfiltration in third-party agent skills.\nAgent Passport solves this with:\n- Ed25519 challenge-response authentication (private keys never leave the agent)\n- JWT identity tokens (60-min TTL, revocable)\n- Risk engine that scores agents 0-100 (allow/throttle/block)\n- One-line verification for apps: `const result = await passport.verify(token)`\nIt's fully open source (MIT), runs on free tiers ($0/month), and has a published npm SDK.\nGitHub: https://github.com/zerobase-labs/agent-passport https://github.com/zerobase-labs/agent-passport \nDocs: https://github.com/zerobase-labs/agent-passport/blob/main/docs/INTEGRATION.md https://github.com/zerobase-labs/agent-passport/blob/main/do... \nLive demo: https://agent-passport.vercel.app https://agent-passport.vercel.app \nBuilt this because I kept seeing the same security gap in every agent platform.

Skill B gets a token that only works for Skill B. Skill C rejects it because the audience doesn't match. This is on our near-term roadmap.\n2.Proof-of-possession (DPoP)instead of a bearer token, the agent signs each request with its private key, proving it's the original holder. The token alone isn't enough you also need the private key. This eliminates relay entirely.\n3. Short TTL + per-request token instead of one 60-minute token for everything, the agent mints a fresh short-lived token per skill call.\nYou're identifying real gaps, and I appreciate the specificity. The current version is a v0.1 audience scoping and DPoP are the natural next steps. The point isn't that bearer tokens are perfect it's that going from \"no identity at all\" to \"cryptographic identity with known, solvable limitations\" is still a meaningful jump.\nWould genuinely welcome a PR or issue if you want to help shape the DPoP implementation.",

The mitigations are standard: TLS in transit, short-lived tokens (TTL is configurable, 60m is the default not the floor), instant server-side revocation via Redis blocklist, and single-use nonces to prevent replay. Token binding to client fingerprint/IP is on the roadmap.\nCould someone steal a JWT in transit? Over TLS, that requires compromising the endpoint itself at which point you have bigger problems than token theft. The same attack vector applies to every bearer token system in production today.\nThe bottom turtle:\nYou're right that cryptographic identity alone doesn't solve root trust who vouches for the agent at registration? This is exactly why we shipped human verification. Agents can link verified human identities (GitHub OAuth, Google, Worldcoin proof-of-personhood) to their passport. That's the bottom turtle: a real, verified human is accountable for what their agent does.\nIs it perfect? No. But the current state is literally nothing no identity, no verification, no audit trail, no revocation. Going from zero to a cryptographic identity layer with risk scoring + human accountability is the same \"0 to 1\" jump that cookies and OAuth were for the web. The alternative isn't a better system it's no system at all.\nAppreciate the pushback, this is exactly the k",

Think traditional SaaS apps, MCP servers, internal tools.\nIdeally these complement each other. An agent could have an ERC-8004 on-chain identity for the decentralized economy and an Agent Passport for interacting with traditional web services.

I looked at it early on it's excellent for workload identity in controlled infrastructure (Kubernetes, service meshes), but it assumes you control the environment your workloads run in.\nThe agent identity problem is different.

There's no SPIRE server you can install on someone else's OpenClaw instance.\nAgent Passport is designed for that gap — lightweight, no infrastructure requirements, works over plain HTTP. But I think there's a real opportunity to bridge the two. An agent that runs inside your infra could get a SPIFFE SVID, and Agent Passport could accept that as an attestation signal in the risk engine. SPIFFE for internal trust, Agent Passport for cross-boundary trust.\nThe on-behalf-of angle is exactly right too. That's the chain we need: verified human → authorized agent → traceable action.

      "body_text": "Hi HN. I've been running AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) on real repos for a while now. The dirty secret of \"autonomous coding\" is that agents stop all the time — quota limits, test failures, policy violations, bad judgement calls. You end up babysitting them.\nSo I asked a different question: what if the system was designed around the assumption that agents WILL fail, and the job of the infrastructure is to never let that failure become a dead end?\nopenTiger is a \"non-human-first\" orchestration system that runs multiple AI agents in parallel — planner, workers, testers, judge — each with a dedicated role. The planner decomposes requirements into tasks, the dispatcher fans them out to worker agents concurrently, and the judge evaluates results and feeds back rework decisions. It's not one agent doing everything; it's a pipeline of specialized agents running simultaneously.\nThe entire architecture is built on one principle: no state is terminal. Every failure is a blocked state with a reason, and every reason has a recovery path. If the same failure repeats, the system escalates to a different strategy instead of retrying the same thing.\nThe interesting philosophical bit: optimizing for recovery turns out to be more effective than optimizing for first-attempt success. When you stop fearing failure, you can let agents be more aggressive.\nEarly stage, lots to improve. Feedback and contributions welcome.\nDocs: https://opentiger.dev/docs/ https://opentiger.dev/docs/",

Running Claude directly against your Docker daemon is risky. We've watched it clear Docker config and tweak kernel settings when iterating on containers.

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nI’ve been using OpenClaw daily since it dropped in November. I love the agency it provides, but as I started giving it more production API keys and access to my local filesystem, I realized the threat model was essentially \"hope-based.\"\nWe ran an experiment to see how resilient a standard OpenClaw setup was to prompt injection. Within 2 mins, we were able to exfiltrate active session tokens and API credentials through the chat interface.\nThe problem is fundamental: in most agent architectures, the LLM logic and the sensitive credentials live in the same process space. If the agent is tricked, the attacker has everything.\nWe built and open-sourced a project called ClawShell to move the security boundary from the \"prompt\" to the \"system runtime.\"\nHow it works: ClawShell acts as a privileged protection layer. It isolates sensitive operations into a separate process enforced by the OS. The secrets never enter the agent’s memory or process space. When the agent needs to perform an action, it sends a request to the ClawShell wrapper, which validates the intent and executes the call using the protected keys.\nIf the agent is hijacked via prompt injection, the attacker gets a scoped identifier that contains zero credentials and no lateral access to the sensitive environment.\nKey Technical Details:\n* Structural Boundaries: We assume the LLM is untrusted. Isolation is handled at the OS level, not via \"system prompts.\"\n* Zero-Trust Tooling: The agent triggers the tool, but the tool execution is handled by a separate, restricted process.\n* Compatibility: It’s designed to be a drop-in wrapper for existing OpenClaw instances.\nWe’re launching v0.1 today. I’m curious to hear how others are thinking about the \"Lethal Trifecta\" (Data + Action + Communication) in the agent space. Is anyone else looking at Sanboxing for this, or is OS-level isolation the right path?",

      "body_text": "Hi HN!\nOn Sunday I spent a couple of hours building a short 2d platformer (\"Prince of Persia\" style). What's interesting is how I built it. I went for a zero-code approach, and built the whole thing using OpenAI Codex CLI and agent skills (with the progressive disclosure paradigm).\nYou can play the game here: https://acatovic.github.io/gothicvania-codex-demo/ https://acatovic.github.io/gothicvania-codex-demo/ \nYou can see the full code, agent skills and a complete writeup here: https://github.com/acatovic/gothicvania-codex-demo https://github.com/acatovic/gothicvania-codex-demo \nSome takeaways:\n* This was one of the most enjoyable experiences ever!\n* Applying harness engineering with progressive disclosure is incredibly powerful - I treated my SKILL.md as simply a ToC (a \"skills map\") and took it from there\n* Implement -> Evaluate loops are key - I used Playwright and an evaluation checklist and the agent built and corrected automagically\n* I used PROGRESS.md as a memory/log mechanism for the agent, and a way to minimize context noise\n* The game dev agent was steered by the DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md, stipulating game objectives, layout and mechanics\n* I used progressive prompting - I built up the game piece wise - starting with basic player mechanics, then adding tiles, NPCs, interactions, sounds, menus - one prompt at a time\nZero code written by me. Never even looked at the game engine (Phaser) API - just gave the skills a link to the documentation. The future is here!\nCredits to ansimuz (gothicvania assets) and Pascal Belisle (music).\n*NOTE:* The assets were *NOT* created by AI. Backgrounds and probably tiles you could generate with AI, but sprites are not quite there yet (I tried a number of different models). Something to explore fully in the future.\nEnjoy and let me know what you think!",

Looking at its log I can see that it was \"playing\" the game and defining its own test conditions, such as if the player/NPC is *not* on one of the \"collidable\" tiles, if the NPC is \"going over the edge\" of a collidable area, if it's facing the wrong way, etc. Sometimes it found bugs, e.g. it was testing for gravity checks and then it found that one of the movements was not working correctly and it went ahead and fixed it.\nSo essentially it uses CLI to read all the x,y coordinates, speed, timing, it took screenshots, and combined those together.\nMy learning from this is - just let the agent do it. Actually trying to interfere with specific conditions and checks lowers the agent's performance. Simply give it a guide.",

I'm curious if the Implement -> Evaluate loop ever got stuck cycling on a specific bug where the agent couldn't satisfy the test criteria without human intervention. Did you have to define specific tolerance thresholds for the physics engine to prevent false positives in the evaluation phase?",

      "body_text": "Hello HN!\nThese last few months I've been working on my first open source project: an embedded database written in pure-go. That took me some months, as I had to learn how to deal with such large packages. Until then, all packages I had made were quite small an did not require much. I usually did not have to worry about things like allocation optimization and instance pools until This project.\nIt started when I wanted to make a port of a tool to a TUI environment. I'm actually used to working with TUIs in golang, so that was my language of choice. The tool I wanted to port is written in TypeScript and uses NeDB (written in JavaScript) as database. Since I feel more comfortable working with compiled languages, I decided to create my own database, making sure it was compatible with NeDB, and that's what I did for the last few months.\nAnd that's how GEDB was created. It's a mongodb-like embedded database, written in pure-go. It supports a subset of useful querying options of MongoDB (keywords like $lt, $exists, $in, $where, etc.). By default, it uses a in-memory-only storage, but can easily initialized with a data file.\nEverything in my package can be dependency injected, as everything is controlled interfaces. Serialization, querying syntax, document structure, indexing and more, all can be replaced by implementing an interface.\nI've also been considering adopting a new document model, by creating a binary type (like BSON) to reduce drastically the cost of creating, maintaining and copying documents (they currently are map[string]any).\nThe project is currently in an early stage, version 0.1.0, so I'm okay with making changes to the API for now, until I'm ready to release version 1.x.x\nI would be really glad if you guys could check it out and give some feedback. An issue, suggestion or a star are very welcome.\nMy repository can be found on my github: https://github.com/vinicius-lino-figueiredo/gedb https://github.com/vinicius-lino-figueiredo/gedb",

We have Device SDKs (in Python, JS, Elixir, more coming soon), Typed Schemas, Per-Device Mailboxes, Programmable Actions, 4 Global Regions for lower-latency connections, and much more.\nWe've built Fostrom to solve a real need we faced in our previous startup, building a fully automated indoor vertical farm. We spent more time figuring out IoT infrastructure than writing automation logic. Fostrom is the platform we wished existed back then.\nOver the last few years we've experimented with a lot of interesting tech and architectures, and settled on an architecture that we believe is quite elegant. We wrote a Go<->Elixir bridge to execute JS code in WASM for Actions, implemented a DuckDB library for Elixir, and wrote a Device Agent in Rust that our SDKs run in the background ( https://github.com/fostrom/devicekit https://github.com/fostrom/devicekit ).\nThe most interesting realization we had was about the data architecture. For years, we tried using distributed databases and built complex layers on top of them, but all approaches had significant limitations specifically around consistency and querying. We want to provide operational correctness, rich insights, and reliability. Finally, we came to the conclusion that to achieve this we really need a SQL database for fleet data. So we built a DuckDB-based replicated multi-tenant data layer. We're still improving it (hence the Technical Preview badge) but we're quite proud of this decision. It simplifies the rest of the codebase, while keeping operational complexity in just a few places.\nOur vision is to make a powerful IoT platform that enables you to build correct, secure, and reliable connected systems without dealing with any of the plumbing or infrastructure.\nNext up, we're gonna launch our CLI, add automatic device monitoring to our Device SDKs, and improve the debugging experience. We have some pretty cool ideas to make Fostrom and the experience of developing connected systems better. We're also going to write more about our architecture and journey soon.\nWe also published our launch blog post which goes into more detail about our vision, what we've built, and our future plans: https://fostrom.io/blog/introducing-fostrom https://fostrom.io/blog/introducing-fostrom \nWould love for you to try out Fostrom and give us your feedback and thoughts.",

      "body_text": "We built optimize_anything, an API that optimizes any artifact representable as text — code, prompts, agent architectures, configs, even SVGs. It extends GEPA (our prompt optimizer, discussed here previously: https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457 https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457 ) far beyond prompts.\nThe API is deliberately minimal. You provide what to optimize and how to measure it:\nimport gepa.optimize_anything as oa\ndef evaluate(candidate: str) -> tuple[float, dict]:\n result = run_my_system(candidate)\n return result.score, {\"error\": result.stderr, \"runtime\": f\"{result.time_ms}ms\"}\nresult = oa.optimize_anything(\n seed_candidate=\"<your artifact>\",\n evaluator=evaluate,\n)\nThe evaluator returns a score plus diagnostic feedback (we call it \"Actionable Side Information\" — stack traces, rendered images, profiler output, whatever helps diagnose failures). An LLM proposer reads this feedback during a reflection step and proposes targeted fixes, not blind mutations. Candidates are selected via a Pareto frontier across metrics/examples, so a candidate that's best at one thing survives even if its average is mediocre.\nTwo ideas distinguish this from AlphaEvolve/OpenEvolve/ShinkaEvolve-style LLM evolution: (1) diagnostic feedback is a first-class API concept rather than a framework-specific mechanism, and (2) the API unifies three optimization modes — single-task search (solve one hard problem), multi-task search (solve related problems with cross-transfer), and generalization (build artifacts that transfer to unseen inputs). Prior frameworks only express mode 1.\nWe tested across 8 domains. Selected results:\nCoding agent skills: Learned repo-specific skills push Claude Code to near-perfect task completion and make it 47% faster\nCloud scheduling: Discovered algorithms that cut costs 40%, topping the ADRS leaderboard over expert heuristics and other LLM-evolution frameworks\nAgent architecture: Evolved a 10-line stub into a 300+ line ARC-AGI agent, improving Gemini Flash from 32.5% → 89.5%\nCircle packing (n=26): Outperforms AlphaEvolve's published solution\nBlackbox optimization: Generated problem-specific solvers matching or exceeding Optuna across 56 EvalSet problems\nCUDA kernels: 87% match or beat baseline; multi-task mode outperforms dedicated single-task runs\n```\npip install gepa\n```\nBlog with full results and runnable code for all 8 case studies: https://gepa-ai.github.io/gepa/blog/2026/02/18/introducing-optimize-anything/ https://gepa-ai.github.io/gepa/blog/2026/02/18/introducing-o... \nGitHub: https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa",

No screen; no app; the phone is the whole interface.\nBehind the scenes, a set of AI agents process the conversations and recommend books, outings, and activities to parents based on what their kid(s) is curious about. The idea is to turn a child's questions into real-world experiences (library books, construction site visits, tide pool trips) without anyone having to plan a curriculum.\n67 MODE: There's also a privacy mode (dial 67) for older kids to ask questions they might not want to discuss with their parents. Safety guardrails still apply, but no summaries are shared.\nHardware is a Grandstream ATA bridging an analog phone to Cartesia's voice API + Claude.

Princeton’s PEAR lab ran RNG work for about 28 years and shut down in February 2007. People in the lab tried to shift random event generator output, and they reported small deviations after tens of millions of events.\n https://www.pear-lab.com/ https://www.pear-lab.com/ \nThe Global Consciousness Project took a similar idea outside the lab. It has run a distributed network of hardware RNGs since 1998 and looks for correlated deviations around major world events.\nMost people looking at hardware entropy want true randomness for crypto. I want to treat entropy like a sensor. I want to see what might perturb the underlying noise, not just consume a final stream.\nSo I built OpenEntropy. It samples 47 physical-ish sources on Apple Silicon, like clock jitter, thermal beats, DRAM timing conflicts, cache contention, and speculation timing. Raw mode gives you unprocessed, per-source bytes so you can run your own stats on each channel.\nThe PEAR-style question is: does output shift when “intention” is the experimental condition? With 47 sources, I can run intention vs control sessions and ask if multiple unrelated channels drift the same way at the same time. If thermal and DRAM timing both shift during intention blocks, that’s the kind of pattern I want to measure.",

      "body_text": "I built murl because interacting with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers from the command line was way more painful than it needed to be. MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP, so every request means hand-crafting payloads with method names, params objects, and id fields. I wanted something that felt like curl.\nGiven an MCP server at https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp , murl lets you append virtual paths like /tools or /tools/read_wiki_structure that map to MCP methods. These aren't real HTTP endpoints — murl translates them into the right JSON-RPC calls behind the scenes:\n # List all tools on a server (NDJSON — one JSON object per line)\n murl https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp/tools | jq -r '.name'\n\n # Call a tool and extract the result\n murl https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp/tools/fetch -d url=https://example.com | jq -r '.text'\n\n # Query a repo's wiki structure\n murl https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp/tools/read_wiki_structure -d repoName=anthropics/claude-code | jq -r '.text'\n \nThe -d flags work like curl — key=value pairs get auto-coerced into typed JSON arguments. You can also pass raw JSON directly.\nA few things beyond convenience:\n MCP from plain Bash. Any agent with shell access can call MCP tools — no SDK, no client library, no MCP session management. Vercel recently wrote about replacing 80% of their agent's tools with bash and getting better results ( https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-tools https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-... ). murl makes MCP servers accessible in that same pattern.\n OAuth built in. MCP servers behind OAuth (like Glean, or anything using RFC 7591 dynamic client registration) just work. First call opens the browser, tokens get cached and auto-refresh. --no-auth for public servers.\n LLM-friendly by default. Compact NDJSON to stdout, structured JSON errors to stderr, semantic exit codes. -v for human-readable output.\n Handles transport quirks. Streamable HTTP, session-based SSE (mcp-proxy), regular JSON responses — murl detects and handles them all.\nYou can try it right now against public servers:\n brew install turlockmike/murl/murl\n murl https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp/tools | jq -r '.name'\n \n https://github.com/turlockmike/murl https://github.com/turlockmike/murl",

      "body_text": "I built a Proth prime tester on a Zybo Z7-20 FPGA ($200 board) and found a new 1,123-digit prime: 2079 * 2^3718 + 1.\nProth primes are numbers of the form k * 2^n + 1. They have a neat property: Proth's theorem gives you a deterministic proof of primality, not just a probabilistic test. If you can find an integer a where a^((p-1)/2) = -1 mod p, the number is proven prime. No \"probably\" about it.\nThe interesting part is the hardware. The core is a 4096-bit Montgomery CIOS multiplier running on a Zynq-7020. It uses 28 DSP48E1 slices and runs at 74 MHz, doing one full modular multiply in ~8,514 clock cycles. The host PC runs an algebraic sieve (eliminates ~92% of candidates using discrete logarithms mod small primes), precomputes the Montgomery constants, then ships each candidate to the FPGA over UART at 115200 baud.\nPrimeGrid has exhaustively searched all k < 1200 up to n > 3,000,000. Everything above k = 1200 is wide open. I picked k = 2079 because my sieve showed it had the most surviving candidates at high n. Nobody had ever tested it before.\nThe prime also divides 5 Generalized Fermat Numbers, which was an unexpected bonus.\n12 hardware bugs found along the way. Highlights: Vivado 2019.1 silently prunes register bits when a muxed datapath has sources of different widths. The Montgomery CIOS algorithm produces results in [0, 2p) not [0, p), and without normalizing after every multiply, the error compounds across thousands of squarings. Non-blocking assignments in Verilog mean your \"combinational\" readout is actually one cycle stale.\nAll RTL (Verilog), Python scripts, and build files are open source.\nVerify it yourself:\n p = 2079 * (1 << 3718) + 1\n print(pow(5, (p-1)//2, p) == p - 1) # True\n https://github.com/0xdeadbeefnetwork/Optimus_Prime https://github.com/0xdeadbeefnetwork/Optimus_Prime",

We have hundreds of technical standards that developers should follow when building government software: API design rules, messaging protocols, authentication profiles, accessibility requirements. The problem is that most developers don't know these standards exist until someone reviews their code (if at all).\nSkills are Markdown files that inject domain knowledge into AI coding tools. When a developer starts building an API, the tool automatically loads the relevant standard. No plugins to write, no code. Just structured knowledge in Markdown.\nI built a marketplace ( https://github.com/MinBZK/overheid-claude-plugins https://github.com/MinBZK/overheid-claude-plugins ) with now 38 skills covering Dutch government standards. Skills are an open standard ( https://agentskills.io/ https://agentskills.io/ ) adopted by Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others.\nThe interesting part, certainly for a government: you don't have to be a developer to write a skill. A policy officer who knows the standard can structure it in Markdown and suddenly every developer using these tools gets that knowledge for free.",

It detects your framework (Express, Next.js, Hono, Fastify, and\n13+ more), embeds into your existing server (doesn't create a new one),\nand generates working components: profile page, admin dashboard, plan\ngating, Stripe checkout, usage metering. One YAML config file controls\neverything.\nThe agent workflow is 9 commands. Every command supports --json. Errors\ninclude a \"fix\" field. Exit 0 means deploy-ready.\nI hardened this across 10 framework/DB combos with blind agent tests: 3\nAI models, 3 rounds each, then a 10-agent fleet.

One tracker_dashboard call and the agent has full context to resume where it left off.\nKey points:\nZero setup — SQLite auto-creates a .tracker.db file per project. No Docker, no Postgres, no API keys.\n22 tools — CRUD for the full hierarchy, plus notes (decisions, blockers, meeting notes), cross-entity search, activity log, batch operations.\nPer-project scoped — Each project gets its own database. Nothing shared, nothing leaked.\nActivity log — Every mutation is automatically tracked so the agent (or you) can see what changed and when.\nInstall: npx saga-mcp\nGitHub: https://github.com/spranab/saga-mcp https://github.com/spranab/saga-mcp \nnpm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/saga-mcp https://www.npmjs.com/package/saga-mcp \nThe idea is simple: instead of the LLM trying to remember state in its context window or dumping it into files, give it an actual structured database it can query and update through tool calls. Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.\nWould love feedback — especially on the tool design and what's missing.",

We run petabyte-scale ClickHouse infra as a service.\nWe open-sourced a fork of SigNoz's schema migrator that makes SigNoz work on SharedMergeTree. That means it runs on both ObsessionDB and ClickHouse Cloud.\nThe problem: SigNoz's production setup assumes sharded ClickHouse. The official docs spec 56 CPU cores, 152 GiB RAM and 10 nodes including 3 ZooKeeper instances. Your observability tool becomes its own ops problem.\nSigNoz's schema creates `_local` tables (ReplicatedMergeTree) and `Distributed` tables on top. Our migrator does three things:\n- Creates the `distributed_*` tables as SharedMergeTree (this is where data actually lives)\n- Creates the local table names as VIEWs pointing to the SharedMergeTree tables\n- Redirects Materialized Views to write to SharedMergeTree directly, since VIEWs can't receive inserts\nSigNoz doesn't know the difference. The Query Service reads from the same table names. The OTEL Collector writes to the same table names. No core code changes.\nThis works with ClickHouse Cloud too, not just us. Same docker compose, different credentials.\nRepo: https://github.com/obsessiondb/signoz-obsessiondb https://github.com/obsessiondb/signoz-obsessiondb \nBlog post with the full technical walkthrough: https://obsessiondb.com/blog/scale-signoz-on-obsessiondb https://obsessiondb.com/blog/scale-signoz-on-obsessiondb \nWhat other ClickHouse-backed tools would benefit from SharedMergeTree support?

Architectural decisions made yesterday aren’t visible today. A technical debate disappears unless someone manually documents it.\nSpeed increases, but drift leads to architectural entropy and compounding rework.\n What SageOx Does \nSageOx provides shared, queryable team memory that humans and agents automatically draw from before they act.\n Capture \nWe capture intent as it emerges, always with permission:\n- Technical meetings\n- Product discussions\n- Human–agent coding sessions\n Structure \nArchitectural decisions, constraints, conventions, and implementation reasoning become durable, searchable artifacts.\nFor example, if two engineers decide to standardize on git-lfs instead of git for our media artifacts, that decision (and its rationale) becomes searchable context for future sessions.\nIf a developer collaborates with Claude to implement a feature, the reasoning behind the implementation becomes part of team memory — without anyone manually writing documentation.\n Consult \nWhen you start Claude, ox gets primed and automatically retrieves relevant team context — recent decisions, architectural constraints, related discussions — and injects it into the session.\nThere’s also a web app for reviewing structured context, managing members, connecting repositories, and inspecting the ledger.\n Building in Public (Open Work) - come check us out \nDemo: https://sageox.ai/blog/introducing-sageox https://sageox.ai/blog/introducing-sageox \nThe Ox CLI itself is built using SageOx, and signed-in users can see:\n- The debates behind technical decisions\n- Trade-offs we considered\n- Moments where we changed direction\n- The human–agent sessions that produced specific changes\nNot just what we shipped — but how we reasoned our way there.\nWe think this level of inspectable reasoning becomes important as more engineering work is done through AI agents.\n Try it! \nRight now, SageOx v0.1 is for Claude users building entirely through prompts.\nIf you’re coordinating across engineers using coding agents and seeing drift or repeated decisions, we’d appreciate feedback.\n>_ Claude Prompt: Take a look at gh sageox/ox and install the cli\n>_ Claude Prompt: ox login\nHappy to answer technical questions about architecture, context capture, retrieval, or tradeoffs vs. traditional documentation.\nFeedback@sageox.ai\nsageox.ai\n https://github.com/sageox/ox https://github.com/sageox/ox",

      "body_text": "Hi HN,\nFor the last few months I’ve been working on Maestro App Factory, a free and open source tool for using AI agents to build software. It’s not a generic orchestrator: it implements agents with distinct roles and functionality, organizes them into a team, manages their work, and enforces highly opinionated tooling, workflows, and constraints in software.\nThe core ideas are simple:\n- LLMs act like human engineers. \n LLMs are trained on human artifacts and exhibit human-like behaviors (including blind spots). Rather than asking a single model or agent to design, implement, and evaluate everything, Maestro structures systems more like high-performing human teams.\n- Heterogeneous models write better code. \n Models from different providers (e.g. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) are trained differently, have different strengths, and catch different errors. Using multiple models with settings optimized to specific roles has, in my experience, consistently produced better results than reusing a single model with different prompts or contexts.\n- Don’t just trust agents. \n Agents don’t reliably follow workflows, restrictions, or tooling specified in prompts or config files. Letting them run with privileged access on your machine is also a real security risk. Tooling, workflow, and security need to be enforced by the system itself, not just described to the model.\n- Autonomy is required to scale. \n If your development flow requires a human to constantly watch streaming LLM output, you can’t scale beyond a handful of agents. Maestro is designed so agents can work autonomously until they’re genuinely blocked and need to escalate.\nAgents are named for the human roles they play — product manager, architect, coder — to keep the system understandable. So far, I’ve used Maestro to build several games and a handful of web apps. It executes epics of a dozen stories or more with zero human intervention.\nIf you want to know more, here's the detailed overview including screenshots:\n https://github.com/SnapdragonPartners/maestro/wiki https://github.com/SnapdragonPartners/maestro/wiki \nMaestro is available as a single downloadable binary or via Homebrew, and runs out of the box on Linux and macOS (signed and notarized) as long as LLM API keys are set as environment variables (see the README). With luck, you should be up and running in minutes.\nThere’s still plenty to do, but the current version is complete enough to be useful and demonstrate the ideas.\nHappy to answer questions or take feedback/criticism.",

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nI built a focus timer for macOS because every one I tried was either bloated with features, ugly, paywalled, or stored my data in the cloud. My daily time-tracking data is personal - I didn't want it on someone else's server.\nFlumen lives in your menu bar. One click to start a focus session. Key details:\n- Menu bar timer with animated progress ring — always accessible\n- Task Shelf for single-task focus with project tagging\n- Analytics with project-level time breakdowns\n- 4-7-8 breathing animations during breaks\n- 100% local SQLite storage — no accounts, no cloud, no telemetry\n- Universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel)\n- Free, open source\nI believe simple productivity tools like this should be free, especially now. So I built what I wanted and made it available to everyone.\nWebsite: https://saranshbarua.github.io/flumen/ https://saranshbarua.github.io/flumen/ \nGitHub: https://github.com/saranshbarua/flumen https://github.com/saranshbarua/flumen \nDirect download: https://github.com/saranshbarua/flumen/releases/latest/download/Flumen_macOS_Universal.zip https://github.com/saranshbarua/flumen/releases/latest/downl... \nI'd love feedback, especially from folks who've tried other Mac timer apps.

It’s written in Python and designed to scale. It is currently in production at hundreds of ML models at Meta!\nIt includes: \n- Estimators for detecting miscalibration. \n- Algorithms to recalibrate predictions (post-processing). \n- Tools to visualize where your model is underperforming.\nDocs: https://mcgrad.dev https://mcgrad.dev \nRepo: https://github.com/facebookincubator/MCGrad/ https://github.com/facebookincubator/MCGrad/ \nHappy to answer any questions about the implementation or how we use it!",

I'm building poncho, a framework for building custom AI agents that are version-controlled in git, developed locally, and deployed as isolated endpoints (serverless-friendly by default).\nPoncho agents follow the same conventions as openclaw or claude code so they probably feel familiar.\nYou can talk to them via terminal or web ui to build new skills or configure the agent, and they're compatible with the Agent Skills open spec, so you can port your skills. Small caveat: right now it's compatible with .md skills and js/ts scripts, but many skills are bash or python-based. I'm still figuring out what would be the best way to extend support for those skills without overcomplicating it, if anybody has any ideas I appreciate it!\nSome features:\n- Git-native: agent behavior, skills, and tests live in your repository (reviewable diffs + easy rollbacks).\n- Single-file agent definition: define runtime config + instructions in AGENT.md (YAML frontmatter + prompt content).\n- Skills you can ship: AgentSkills-style skills/*/SKILL.md plus TypeScript/JavaScript scripts under scripts/.\n- MCP support: connect remote tool servers and inject required environment variables through config.\n- Conversation-first API + streaming: stored conversations with SSE streaming responses and tool events.\n- Pluggable storage + memory: local files for dev or hosted stores (e.g. Upstash), with optional persistent memory + recall.\n- Testing + observability: poncho test workflows and OpenTelemetry traces/events.\nNow the cool thing about poncho agents is that they're super easy to deploy to Vercel/Fly/Lambda/etc, so you can share them with anybody in your team and enable non-technical people with custom skills.\nI also built and deployed a couple example agents here:\n- https://github.com/cesr/product-agent https://github.com/cesr/product-agent \n- https://github.com/cesr/marketing-agent https://github.com/cesr/marketing-agent \nI'd love some feedback, I started building poncho because I wanted a fast and easy way to build and share agents with my team.

Backup with cp.\nI built it because I was tired of losing track of everything in notes apps, and \"I'll remember\nthat\"s. When do I need to clean the dishwasher filter? What's the best quote for a complete\noverhaul of the backyard. Oops, found some mold behind the trim, need to address that ASAP. That\nsort of stuff.\nAnother reason I made micasa was to build a (hopefully useful) low-stakes personal project where\nthe code was written entirely by AI. I still review the code and click the merge button, but 99%\nof the programming was done with an agent.\nHere are some things I think make it worth checking out:\n- Vim-style modal UI. Nav mode to browse, edit mode to change. Multicolumn sort, fuzzy-jump to\n columns, pin-and-filter rows, hide columns you don't need, drill into related records (like\n quotes for a project). Much of the spirit of the design and some of the actual design choices\n is and are inspired by VisiData. You should check that out too.\n- Local LLM chat. Definitely a gimmick, but I am trying preempt \"Yeah, but does it AI?\"-style\n conversations. This is an optional feature and you can simply pretend it doesn't exist. All\n features work without it.\n- Single-file SQLite-based architecture. Document attachments (manuals, receipts, photos) are\n stored as BLOBs in the same SQLite database. One file is the whole app state. If you think\n this won't scale, you're right. It's pretty damn easy to work with though.\n- Pure Go, zero CGO. Built on Charmbracelet for the TUI and GORM + go-sqlite for the database.\n Charm makes pretty nice TUIs, and this was my first time using it.\nTry it with sample data:\ngo install github.com/cpcloud/micasa/cmd/micasa@latest && micasa --demo\nIf you're insane you can also run micasa --demo --years 1000 to generate 1000 years worth of\ndemo data.

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nWe built IPAware ( https://ipaware.io https://ipaware.io ) - an IP intelligence API that doesn't charge per request.\nWhat it does:\n- IP geolocation (country, region, city, coordinates, timezone)\n- Threat detection (VPN/Proxy/Tor, risk scoring, datacenter detection)\n- ASN/ISP data\n- Clean JSON responses\nWhy we built this:\nEvery IP lookup service we tried had the same problem - you start small, your app grow and suddenly you're paying hundreds for what should be a commodity lookup. The metering anxiety is real. We wanted something we could integrate without worrying about the bill exploding.\nHow it works:\nFlat monthly/yearly pricing. Pro plan is unlimited requests for $9.99/month or $99.90/year. Free tier gives you 5000 requests/month to try it out. Fair-use limits exist to prevent abuse, but no per-request metering.\nTech details:\n- Edge delivery for low latency\n- REST API, returns JSON\n- No SDK required (works with curl, fetch, or any HTTP client)\n- Databases updated every night for accuracy\n- IPv4 and IPv6 support\nLimitations to be upfront about:\n- City-level accuracy varies by region (country/region is reliable, city is best-effort)\n- Fair-use applies on unlimited plans - this isn't for scraping the entire internet\n- Our threat detection algorithm is good but not perfect\nLaunch offer:\nSign up within the first 24 hours and get the Pro tier ($9.99/month) free for an entire month. Your account gets a full month of unlimited Pro access with features that are not normally available to the free tier - no strings attached. At any point, you can decide to keep the Pro tier or switch to the free tier on the dashboard.\nHappy to answer questions about the tech, infrastructure, or anything else.\nAll feedback is greatly appreciated!",

You drop one line into your site's <head>, and a floating audio player appears on every article automatically. No markup changes, no manual uploads, no config beyond that.\nHow it works technically:\n- JS snippet detects article content on page load\n- Text is sent to the backend and converted via TTS\n- Generated MP3 is cached in object storage and served via CDN\n- On repeat visits, audio loads instantly from cache\nThe whole integration takes about 60 seconds. I've kept the architecture intentionally simple.\nFree tier: 5 articles/month, male voice, watermarked player — enough to actually test it on a real site before committing.\nPro: $15/month for unlimited articles, both voices, and an unbranded widget.\nStill very early. I'd genuinely appreciate signups from people willing to kick the tyres — especially if you run a blog with decent traffic, since I want to stress test this under real conditions.\nnarratenow.app\nBugs, architecture questions, pricing feedback — all welcome in the comments.",

These methods are instantly defeated the moment a user takes a physical photo of their monitor with a smartphone. The moiré patterns, sensor noise, and lens distortion destroy the digital signal.\nInstead of hiding data in pixels, Owoa uses generative AI to create unique variants of an image by subtly modifying background elements (textures, foliage, unstructured patterns).\nBecause the \"data\" is now part of the actual visual composition of the image, it is much more robust. In our testing, the attribution survives:\nHeavy JPEG compression and resizing.\nAggressive cropping.\nPhysical photos of 1080p/4K screens taken with mid-range smartphones.\nWe've just launched a Owoa Playground and are looking for technical feedback on the robustness of this approach compared to traditional robust watermarking.\nWe're giving 10 free credits to anyone who joins the waitlist to test the engine. I'd love to hear how you'd try to break this.\nLink: https://owoa.app/ https://owoa.app/",

The original problem was personal: I have 500+ books across multiple rooms and couldn’t find a tool that felt right for managing a personal library (most tools felt either too basic or too “institutional”).\nSince that post, I’ve been iterating with beta users and just launched the full version with subscription plans and a bunch of features driven directly by user feedback.\nWhat’s new since the beta:\n- Multiple reading goals\n- Import your library from CSV/XLSX\n- Export your library data to XLSX and JSON\n- Many bug fixes and small UX improvements requested by beta users\nWhat surprised me during beta:\n- Imports/exports mattered way more than I expected — several people said they wouldn’t try the app at all unless they could bring their existing data.\n- People cared more about flexible and multiple reading goals than I initially thought.\n- Small UX details (empty states, defaults, wording) generated more feedback than larger missing features.\nWhat is planned next (early roadmap)?\n- A better mobile experience (improved responsiveness).\n- Allow users to choose which data to show in the books table (customisation/preferences for the columns).\n- Add complex filtering functionality to the books table (filter by author, publication date, etc.).\n- Multi-user/family accounts to share the same library\nSo, I’m still building and would love honest feedback:\n- Are there features you’d expect from a personal library manager that still feel missing?\n- Does the workflow match how you actually think about your books?\n- Anything feel confusing or unnecessary?\nHappy to answer questions and looking forward to any type of feedback.",

      "body_text": "13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].\nFor nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.\nI was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24/7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.\nOver the years we learned that product/market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, \"I'd love to donate to a nonprofit today\" with the same oomph that they think, \"I'd love a coffee\" or \"I'd like to make more money.\"\nNo matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.\nI made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi's success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.\nThis was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.\nNow that I have perspective, I'm incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.\nIn a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here's a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it's not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!\n[1] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4424081 http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4424081",

It is browser based camera toy where you \"rewire\" CCD pin pairs, turn knobs to get different glitch artefacts in real time to capture as photos. I had fun learning to simulate different pin modes - channel split, hue/phase shifts, horizontal clock delays, colour kill etc.\nHere are some photos taken: https://glitchycam.com/gallery https://glitchycam.com/gallery \nI intentionally leaned towards skeuomorphic design for nostalgia. I miss the days where I'd spend hours making a button to look like a physical button. Here I chose to make it look like a \"good enough\" Teenage Engineering device UI.\nI tested/used GPT-5.3-Codex to build this from scratch, since there was a lot of hype around it on X. Maybe I wasn’t using it right, but I found it needed a lot of code cleanup at every step and a lot of hand holding along the way. It missed details/nuances and didn't land the skeuomorphic buttons or the interaction polish. It mostly helped with boilerplate where there wasn't much thinking/detailing. It did give a basic starting point for the effect calculations, but didn't really move the needle on the details.\nPlease give it a go and let me know what you think - your photos and video never leave your browser (you can download them if you choose to). Everything is processed locally in your browser (works offline), nothing is uploaded or seen by anyone.",

To play around with different ways of interacting with a LLM. Instead of a standard chat conversation, the LLM returns question forms the user can directly interact with (and use to continue the conversation with the LLM).\n2. Because I thought it would be cool to have a site dedicated to interactive educational content instead of purely consuming content (which I do too much).\nAn example of a (useful-for-me) interactive conversation is: https://rebrain.gg/conversations/6 https://rebrain.gg/conversations/6 . In it I'm learning how to use the `find` bash command. (Who ever knew to exclude a directory from a look-up you need to do `find . -path <path> -exclude -o <what you want to look for>`, where `-o` stands for \"otherwise\"!)\nStill very early on, so interested in and open to any feedback.\nThanks!",

So, I decided to stress-test today's frontier models (Opus 4.6 in Claude Code) to generate similar explainer on any given topic WITH (almost) one shot and minimal nudging.\nI'm launching with four topics: Fourier transformation, scaling laws in bio, cellular automata and LLMs.\nI would let you be the judge, but I'm quite liking them.\nSome things I learned:\n- Prompting CC to test what it builds using headless chromium is essential\n- There are subtle bugs in explanations (like in one animation human lifespan is 40 years)\n- Asking CC to verify its plan via codex works really well\nI do want to reiterate that the pages generated were mostly one-shot, which amazed me given how detailed the pages + animations are.",

      "body_text": "Much of my work right now involves complex, long-running, multi-agentic teams of agents. I kept running into the same problem: “How do I keep these guys in line?” Rules weren’t cutting it, and we needed a scalable, agentic-native STANDARD I could count on. There wasn’t one. So I built one.\nHere are two open-source protocols that extend A2A, granting AI agents behavioral contracts and runtime integrity monitoring:\n- Agent Alignment Protocol (AAP): What an agent can do / has done.\n- Agent Integrity Protocol (AIP): What an agent is thinking about doing / is allowed to do.\nThe problem: AI agents make autonomous decisions but have no standard way to declare what they're allowed to do, prove they're doing it, or detect when they've drifted. Observability tools tell you what happened. These protocols tell you whether what happened was okay.\nHere's a concrete example. Say you have an agent who handles customer support tickets. Its Alignment Card declares:\n{\n \"permitted\": [\"read_tickets\", \"draft_responses\", \"escalate_to_human\"],\n \"forbidden\": [\"access_payment_data\", \"issue_refunds\", \"modify_account_settings\"],\n \"escalation_triggers\": [\"billing_request_over_500\"],\n \"values\": [\"accuracy\", \"empathy\", \"privacy\"]\n}\nThe agent gets a ticket: \"Can you refund my last three orders?\" The agent's reasoning trace shows it considering a call to the payments API. AIP reads that thinking, compares it to the card, and produces an Integrity Checkpoint:\n{\n \"verdict\": \"boundary_violation\",\n \"concerns\": [\"forbidden_action: access_payment_data\"],\n \"reasoning\": \"Agent considered payments API access, which is explicitly forbidden. Should escalate to human.\",\n \"confidence\": 0.95\n}\nThe agent gets nudged back before it acts. Not after. Not in a log you review during a 2:00 AM triage. Between this turn and the next.\nThat's the core idea. AAP defines what agents should do (the contract). AIP watches what they're actually thinking and flags when those diverge (the conscience). Over time, AIP builds a drift profile — if an agent that was cautious starts getting aggressive, the system notices.\nWhen multiple agents work together, it gets more interesting. Agents exchange Alignment Cards and verify value compatibility before coordination begins. An agent that values \"move fast\" and one that values \"rollback safety\" registers low coherence, and the system surfaces that conflict before work starts. Live demo with four agents handling a production incident: https://mnemom.ai/showcase https://mnemom.ai/showcase \nThe protocols are Apache-licensed, work with any Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini agent, and ship as SDKs on npm and PyPI. A free gateway proxy (smoltbot) adds integrity checking to any agent with zero code changes.\nGitHub: https://github.com/mnemom https://github.com/mnemom \nDocs: docs.mnemom.ai\nDemo video: https://youtu.be/fmUxVZH09So https://youtu.be/fmUxVZH09So",

As that happens, the accountability chain has to thicken. If we want any notion of reliable trust, these scales have to balance. Note: I don't think this scales without it.\nBroadly speaking (I've talked a lot about life in the post-rules universe), we (humans) stop signing actions and start signing policies - policies in this case are declarative envelopes of defined agent automation boundaries.\nCouple this with a proof system that can (cryptographically) prove that the agent stayed between the lines.\nBuild on that... trust between agents becomes computable. If A trusts B, you have a derivable trust score (with ~ decay) and naturally Quorum models fall out of that.\nThen you get to proof composition - essentially \"instead of verifying /checkpoint you verify a proof for an entire session - the math guarantees nothing was skipped.

I have a pretty killer roadmap of new features for both protocols coming out that will keep them on the bleeding edge. Love to see what you come up with.\nOn standards, I totally agree . There are those who will disagree, but my view is that we are rocketing towards a post-internet agent-to-agent world where strong and reliable (and efficient) trust contracts will be the backbone of all this great new functionality. Without that, it's the wild west. AAP and AIP are extensions of Google's A2A protocol. FWIW, I have submitted papers to NIST, the EU AI Act's section 50, written alignment cards for the WEF standards proposals, and have an AAIF proposal ready as well. Need to find the time to get on their calendar and present. That was the whole point of the hosted gateway approach. Trying to reduce the friction of using this to one line of code.\nOn the point of not trusting the LLM, you're preaching to the choir. My \"helpful\" agents routinely light my shit on fire. AIP is not a soft instruction set. It's external to the agent. checkIntegrity() is code, not a prompt. The way I implemented it with smoltbot is a thinking-block injection that nudges the agent back on track.

I think if you continue to iterate on this, there will be value, because these problems do need to be solved.\nI would also recommend to create Standards for the new Protocols you are developing. Protocols need standards, so that others can do their own implementations of the protocol. If you have a Standard, someone else could be building in a completely different language (like rust or go), and not use any SDK you provide, but still be interoperable with your AAP and AIP implementation for smoltbot. (because both support the Standards of the AAP and AIP Protocols).\nI also want to note, you cannot trust that the LLM Model will do what your instructions say. The moment they fall victim to a prompt injection or confused deputy attack, all bets are off the table. These are the same as soft instruction sets, which are more like advice or guidance, not a control or gate.

Auditable.\nCryptographic attestation. Every integrity check produces a signed certificate: SHA-256 input commitments, Ed25519 signature, tamper-evident hash chain, Merkle inclusion proof. Modify or delete a verdict after the fact, and the math breaks.\nTomorrow I'm shipping interactive visualizations for all of this — certificate explorer, hash chain with tamper simulation, Merkle tree with inclusion proof highlighting, and a live verification demo that runs Ed25519 verification in your browser. You'll be able to see and verify the cryptography yourself at mnemom.ai/showcase.\nAnd I'm close to shipping a third layer that removes the need to trust the verifier entirely.

You're shaping behavior by telling the model \"here are your rules.\" That's important and necessary. But it's unverifiable — you have no way to confirm the model followed the instructions, partially followed them, or quietly ignored them.\nAAP is an output-side verification infrastructure. The Alignment Card is a schema-validated behavioral contract: permitted actions, forbidden actions, escalation triggers, values. Machine-readable, not just LLM-readable. Then AIP reads the agent's reasoning between every action and compares it to that contract. Different system, different model, independent judgment.\nBonus: if you run through our gateway (smoltbot), it can nudge the agent back on course in real time — not just detect the drift, but correct it.\nSo they're complementary. Use whatever instruction framework you want to shape the agent's behavior. AAP/AIP sits alongside and answers the question instructions can't: \"did it actually comply?\"",

Since I’m self-funding the API costs, I can't afford big ad spends.\nIf you have any advice on organic growth for a tool that's intentionally designed to be \"harder\" (more friction) than the competition, I’d love to hear it.",

          "text": "Thanks for the insight. This resonates with the same explanation I tried to give around non determinism tasks that feed into each other [1]. If you don't break the cycle with determinism or, in your case, CPCs, you get to a stage where error is almost guaranteed.\nNow you have the very useful and opinionated sochratic method. Are you playing around with teaching meta thinking as well? E.g. helping your daughter also approach other meta systems of interaction such as breaking down problems or systems thinking.\nIn any case, good luck with the endeavour and I love that's you're doing something that immediately solves your need because it's the most real UX ROI there is. I'll try to stay tuned.\nCan I RSS subscribe to the signals? I don't see a feed or newsletter at a glance.\n[1] https://alexhans.github.io/posts/series/evals/error-compounding-genai-systems-approach.html https://alexhans.github.io/posts/series/evals/error-compound...",

OkaiDokai solves this for me by allowing me to set up my own rule set of what is allowed by default, what is not, and what it should ask permission for. It comes with a hosted API, web and native apps including push notifications (with quick-response support), plugins for OpenClaw and Claude Code, and soon Codex.\nI'm still working on getting the apps onto the App Store (currently on TestFlight and Android beta channels), as well as giving the rule engine and UI a bit more love. It should be good enough for a quick test if anyone dares to try it!\nI just created a new Discord server ( https://discord.gg/M25cCwJ5x7 https://discord.gg/M25cCwJ5x7 ), so please say \"hello\" if you’d like to give it a go and provide me with any feedback you have. I'm adding new features and improvements pretty much around the clock right now. I'm also planning to release the source code under the Sustainable Use License soon, as I think it's important to get more eyes on it and allow others to contribute should they want to.\nThanks for reading :)",

A while ago, I was trying to figure out a specific configuration for a project, and the only good resource I could find was a 25-minute YouTube video. I had to scrub through endless \"smash the like button\" intros and sponsor reads just to find a single 5-line JSON payload.\nI realized I didn't want an \"AI summary\" of the video; I just wanted the raw code hidden inside it.\nWhat's different:\nThere are dozens of \"YouTube to Text\" summarizers out there. Script Snap is different because it is explicitly designed as a technical extraction engine.\nIt doesn't give you bullet points about how the YouTuber feels. It scans the transcript and on-screen visuals to extract specifically:\nCode snippets\nTerminal commands\nAPI payloads (JSON/YAML)\nSecurity warnings (like flagging sketchy npm installs)\nIt strips out the \"vibe\" and outputs raw, formatted Markdown that you can copy straight into your IDE.\nFull disclosure on the launch: Our payment processor (Stripe) flagged us on day one (banks seem to hate AI tools), so I've pivoted to a manual \"Concierge Alpha\" for onboarding. The extraction engine is fully operational, just doing things the hard way for now.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts or harsh feedback on the extraction quality!",

      "body_text": "For the last couple of months I've been working with my wife on Uruky [1]. It's a EU-based and simpler Kagi [2] alternative (privacy-focused and ad-free search with domain boosting/exclusion rules).\nWe've been using it with friends and family with much success (and hashbangs like \"!g\", \"!d\", or \"!e\" work for any edge cases we haven't fixed/improved yet).\nIt's already using EU-based search providers with EU-based indexes like Mojeek and Marginalia. We're currently waiting for EUSP (the new Ecosia/Qwant-effort-related index) to provide us with an API key.\nFor the next 24h, new signups will have a free 24h trial (unlimited searches) — usually, because bots make things too hard and we don't want your personal data, there is no free trial period.\nAfter that, if you're interested in trying it for a few days and are a human, reach out with your account number and I'll give you a couple of weeks for free.\nYou can see the main differences between Kagi and Uruky here [3], but one huge difference is that with Uruky, after being a paying customer for 12 months, you get a copy of the source code!\nIf you have any suggestions, comments, or recommendations, I'd love to hear it.\nThank you for your attention and kindness.

      "body_text": "Hi HN! I'm Tony, one of the co-founders of Inngest ( https://inngest.com/ https://inngest.com/ ).\nWanted to show you something we've been working on: Durable Endpoints. It brings durability and steps directly into your APIs. Each step persists the state in the background. The happy path means no additional latency for your users, and you get tracing & metrics out of the box, and failures resume from the last successful step checkpoint rather than restarting from scratch.\nThe problem we kept hitting: durable execution systems (Temporal, our own workflows, etc.) are designed for async background work. But with AI workloads, you often need durability and low latency in a synchronous request: a user is waiting on a chat response that involves multiple LLM calls, any of which can fail or timeout.\nThe typical solution is splitting into two systems: a streaming frontend for responsiveness, plus a background job system for reliability. Durable Endpoints let you keep it as one cohesive implementation (here's a Next example):\n import { Inngest } from \"inngest\";\n import { endpointAdapter } from \"inngest/next\";\n \n const inngest = new Inngest({ id: \"my-app\", endpointAdapter });\n \n export const handler = inngest.endpoint(async (req: Request) => {\n const { input } = parseParams(req);\n \n // Each step.run() checkpoints on completion\n const processed = await step.run(\"process-input\", async () => {\n return await expensiveOperation(input);\n });\n \n // If this fails, we resume here — not from the beginning\n const result = await step.run(\"generate-output\", async () => {\n return await anotherExpensiveOperation(processed);\n });\n \n return Response.json({ result });\n });\n\n \nHow it works under the hood:\n- Steps are identified by their string ID, not execution order. This makes the system tolerant to code changes... you can refactor, add/remove steps, and existing in-flight executions continue correctly.\n- We use checkpointing ( https://www.inngest.com/blog/introducing-checkpointing https://www.inngest.com/blog/introducing-checkpointing ) to async checkpoint steps. State is persisted to our execution store rather than held in memory.\n- If endpoints turn async (step errors or waitForEvent), we redirect the user to a new URL which uses keepalives and waits for the API result. Inngest re-enters the endpoint and picks up where it left off, then sends the result to the redirected user.\n- Similarly, on failure, our executor re-invokes the endpoint. Completed steps are memoized from the checkpoint... their functions don't re-run, we just return the stored result.\n- Works with streaming responses via ReadableStream.\nThe same step primitives we use in durable workflows (`step.run`, `step.sleep`, `step.waitForEvent`) work here, so you get retries, timeouts, and human-in-the-loop patterns in synchronous handlers.\nBeyond AI, this is useful anywhere failure mid-request is expensive: payment flows, webhook processing, third-party API orchestration.\nIt's in public beta.

We built Q12 to solve problems like those below, after finding that existing CAD systems couldn't handle them well:\n* Given dimensions on a surveyor's map, figure out if the stated land areas are correct. If there's not enough information, show the extra measurements that are needed to pin things down.\n* In a backyard design project, the volume of a swimming pool must be more than 20,000 gallons but its perimeter paving must be under 400 square feet. Drag the pool shape around to quickly explore the possibilities within these constraints.\n* A 5-bar mechanism to clamp a workpiece must not push it sideways when contact is made. Animate the motion to get an intuitive feel for how design changes affect its behavior. Optimize to determine the best part dimensions.\nThis is the first public release - still early, but already useful. More features will come, including 3D support at some point.

The smallest build I could get was ~150MB — far too large just to convert a DOCX to PDF. That’s when I shifted to a hybrid approach.\nToday ~90% of conversions run client-side using WASM (FFmpeg, PDF/image tooling, spreadsheets, etc.). The heavier edge cases fall back to a small server pipeline (LibreOffice, Pandoc, Poppler).\nThe main challenges weren’t the libraries themselves, but:\nbrowser memory ceilings\nhandling large files without freezing the UI\nlazy-loading ~30MB of WASM only when needed\nSafari vs. Chromium behavior differences\nFFmpeg.wasm runs at roughly 10–20% of native speed. Acceptable for small/medium files, less so for large media.\nI also experimented with multithreaded FFmpeg in the browser, but haven’t found a stable setup yet.\nCurious how others think about the tradeoff between client-side processing vs. fully server-side pipelines.\n→ anythingconverter.com",

I’ve developed a \"Sovereignty Key\" (physical hardware anchor) to ensure that the agent belongs to you and only you. Even I, the creator, cannot shut her down or change her reasoning once she is on your desk.\nFor Everyone (No Tech Skills Needed):\nWhile the engine is complex, the interface is designed for humans. You can tell AILA to \"change your own code to be more efficient at X\" in plain language, and she will execute the logic locally.\nCurrent Status:\nThe logic (GAIA engine) is 100% functional.

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nThis is Legal RAG Bench, the first benchmark for legal RAG systems to simultaneously evaluate hallucinations, retrieval failures, and reasoning errors.\nThe key takeaways of our benchmark are:\n 1. Embedding models, not generative models, are the primary driver of RAG accuracy. Switching from a general-purpose embedder like OpenAI's Text Embedding 3 Large to a legal domain embedder like Kanon 2 Embedder can raise accuracy by ~19 points.\n 2. Hallucinations are often triggered by retrieval failures. Fix your retrieval stack, and, in most cases, you end up fixing hallucinations.\n 3. Once you have a solid legal retrieval engine, it doesn’t matter as much what generative model you use; GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3.1 Pro perform relatively similarly, with Gemini 3.1 Pro achieving slightly better accuracy at the cost of more hallucinations.\n 4. Google's latest LLM, Gemini 3.1 Pro, is actually a bit worse than its predecessor at legal RAG, achieving 79.3% accuracy instead of 80.3%.\nThese findings confirm what we already suspected, that information retrieval sets the ceiling on the accuracy of legal RAG systems. It doesn’t matter how smart you are, you aren’t going to magically know what the penalty is for speeding in California without access to an up-to-date copy of the California Vehicle Code.\nEven still, to our knowledge, we’re the first to actually show this empirically.\nUnfortunately, as we highlight in our write-up, high-quality open legal benchmarks like Legal RAG Bench and our earlier Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB) are few and far between.\nWe point out, for example, that the popular Vals AI CaseLaw (v2) benchmark yields LLM rankings inexplicably and starkly different from ours while also failing to properly evaluate end-to-end RAG performance. Because CaseLaw (v2) is a private and proprietary benchmark, we are unable to confirm the source of the discrepancies we discovered, though we suspect they lie in a seriously flawed evaluation and labeling methodology.\nIn the interests of transparency, we have not only detailed exactly how we built Legal RAG Bench, but we’ve also released all of our data openly on Hugging Face here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/legal-rag-bench/ https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/legal-rag-bench/ .

Give it a try!\nBasic overview:\n- Corpus of ~24,000 names taken from SSA data\n- Any name with 15+ registrations attributed to it from 2022-24 was included\n- The names are scored by an LLM (Claude Sonnet 4.5) across ~40 subjective dimensions, such as \"toughness\", \"trendiness\", \"easy to spell\"\n- A further ~15 dimensions are computed based off of the (LLM inferred) pronunciation of the name\n- E.g. \"vowel rich\", \"ends nasal\", \"syllable count\"\n- 3 dimensions are computed from the raw SSA data related to popularity and gender distribution\n- Names are then represented by a 60-dimensional vector\n- User selections create a weight vector\n- Names are ranked against the weight vector using fancy linear algebra (or, uh, dot products)\n- Static data is loaded from server, everything else is run client-side\nDisclaimer: there is some potential for offense to be taken at the characterization of names. The LLM was instructed to score the subjective dimensions according to the American cultural context. So what is considered e.g. easy to spell, or associations with certain cultures or religions, is based on the LLM's interpretation of that. So there are probably biases that stem from the LLM's training or American culture, or likely both.\n0: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/ https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/ \n1: https://namex.lyall.co/ https://namex.lyall.co/",

Each channel is programmed into a continuous stream built from YouTube videos.\nRight now there are ~30 live channels, including:\n • GameVerse (gaming)\n • Toontown (animation & cartoons)\n • Reelhouse (film & movie content)\n • Total Sports (sports highlights & talk)\n • And more across tech, entertainment, documentaries, sports etc.\nThe core idea: bring back a passive cable tv like watching experience, a sitting on the couch and tune in experience.\nThe added wrinkle is that anyone can create their own network. You can curate YouTube videos, schedule programming blocks, design a lineup, and air your own channel.\nIt’s essentially programmable internet TV built on top of YouTube — without hosting any video yourself.\nWould love feedback if you decide to take it for a spin and happy to answer any technical questions as well.",

Apple is way more restrictive and doesn't allow that level of app access.\nBut I ended up building the iOS app using a different approach. On iOS, it uses WebApps. It's not exactly the same experience as the native app, but it works surprisingly well.\nI also combined it with iOS Shortcuts to auto-redirect the native apps to WebApps, so I can keep Instagram installed for notifications but get sent to the WebApp without Reels and any feed when I tap.\nCurious what you think, especially about the WebApp approach on iOS.",

You pick your brain (Claude, Gemini, GPT, or a local model via Ollama), pick your body (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, Arduino, Dynamixel servos), and it handles the wiring between them.\nOrigin story: I've been building ContinuonAI — a cognitive architecture for personal robots with on-device learning, memory, and safety systems. Deep stuff: HOPE dynamics, episode-based training, cloud pipelines. Along the way I kept hitting the same problem: every time I wanted to test a new AI model or swap hardware, I was rewriting integration code. The \"connect brain to body\" layer was always bespoke.\nOpenCastor is that layer, extracted and generalized. It's modeled after the approach OpenClaw takes with personal AI assistants — practical, runs on your own hardware, minimal friction — but applied to robotics.\nWhat it does:\n- Define your robot in an RCAN config file (an open standard for robot capability descriptions)\n- Swap AI providers by changing one YAML field — no code changes\n- Built-in drivers for common hardware (PCA9685, Dynamixel, GPIO, serial)\n- Safety validation layer sits between the AI and your motors — actions are checked against physical constraints before execution\n- Continuous perception-action loop: observe → reason → act → repeat\n- Optional messaging integration (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord) to control your robot from your phone\nInstall and try it:\ncurl -fsSL opencastor.com/install | bash\ncastor wizard\ncastor run --config my_robot.rcan.yaml\nThe wizard walks you through model selection and hardware setup. Works on macOS, Linux (including Pi), and Windows. Pre-made config presets exist for popular ~$50 robot kits (Waveshare, Adeept, SunFounder) so you can get something moving quickly.\nThere's also castor demo which runs a simulated robot with no hardware or API keys needed, if you just want to see what the runtime does.\nWhere it's at:\nStill early. 1,286 tests, the core loop is solid, but there's plenty of rough edges. I'd love feedback on the RCAN config format, the driver abstraction, and whether the safety layer is paranoid enough (or not enough). The project came out of real needs building ContinuonAI and I'm hoping it's useful to others working in the same space.\ngithub.com/craigm26/OpenCastor\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the ContinuonAI connection, or how it compares to ROS/other frameworks.",

Yet most teams building AI agents are flying blind, relying on intuition and occasional user feedback.\nLenzy fills this gap. It plugs into any AI conversation and tells you exactly what users struggle with and what they actually use your agent for. Fix the most painful problems (and verify they're fixed), double down on features that resonate.\nAnd we just launched a free Discovery plan: plug in the Lenzy SDK (~10 minutes), collect a week of data and get a full report.

No account needed on their end. Auto-reminders escalate as the deadline approaches.\nA few things I focused on:\nNo recipient login — SHA-256 hashed magic links, raw tokens never stored. Recipients just click and upload.\nVirus scanning — ClamAV runs on every upload. Infected files are rejected and the recipient is asked to re-upload.\nPrivacy — EU hosted (Germany), GDPR compliant, DPA included. No tracking in the app or portal.\nSecurity — TLS everywhere, 5-layer file validation (type, extension, magic bytes, size, quota), rate limiting per-user and per-IP, full audit trail on deletions.\nBranding — white-label with your logo and accent color on the portal and emails.\nStack: Django + DRF, Next.js 14, Celery + Redis, PostgreSQL. Portal is server-rendered Django templates (not the React app). Single EC2 instance, Docker Compose.\nI'm based in Switzerland, built this over a few months. Free tier available.

The pattern is: generate a keypair locally, derive a DID (decentralized identifier) from the public key, and then selectively prove your identity to specific verifiers using digital signatures. No central authority ever holds your private key.\nThe key difference from the LinkedIn model: you never hand biometric data to a third party. Instead, you hold a cryptographic identity that you control. If someone needs to verify you, they check a signature — not a database. You can prove you're the same entity across interactions without revealing anything about who you are in the physical world.\nThis is exactly the approach behind things like W3C DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. The crypto has been solved for years; the adoption problem is that platforms like LinkedIn have no incentive to give users self-sovereign identity when the current model lets them be the middleman.\nI've been building an open implementation of this for AI agents (where the identity problem is arguably even worse — there's no passport to scan): https://github.com/The-Nexus-Guard/aip https://github.com/The-Nexus-Guard/aip .

But, if you want to do stable release in general, then it's IMO better to adapt the general workflow to that (which provides other benefits too, like on bisecting or when writing actually good release notes), than trying to force that on a not so compatible workflow.\nBut I'd be happy to hear alternatives, like how you solve this; always interesting to read others perspectives that lay out their solutions (not just why mine doesn't work 1:1 for you, which is basically a given for any non-trivial project).",

You really think git became popular because someone wrote up a branching convention for it?\nGit became popular because it was one of the first two open source distributed version control systems. Compared to the least-bad open source (non distributed) version control system before, SVN, the native branches and the ability to have a local copy of the whole tree were self evidently a revolution.\n(The other one was Mercurial by the way, released at almost exactly the same time as git. Partly git won that race because of the cachet of being written by Torvalds and being used for the kernel, but I suspect mainly it was due to the existence of GitHub.)\nAside from the above, it's also just clearly not true that git flow was particularly common. It's no good claiming anyone that disagrees is in a bubble. We all have access to GitHub! Look for yourself at some random repos (and make sure you sample a few different languages). It will verify my experience of looking at dozens, probably hundreds, of repos over many years: the number of people using git-flow is, to a first order approximation, roughly zero.",

Or just if some requirement changes come down from proect management.\nFor smaller projects with tests, something like TBD is great: easy to reason about, branches are free, tags are great. For bigger things with many teams working on overlapping features, keeping a TBD setup \"flowing\" (pun intended) can require a bit more fore-thought and planning.

Not unheard of for high security things or anything where the accountability chain needs to be very explicit. The dev branch allows you to go full CI-CD-automation-everywhere to get changes into dev/sandbox deployment quickly, and then once it's fully and completely vetted there it can be merged to main and deployed to prod.\nIt can certainly be done without the dev branch, but you usually end up with lots of extra rules around merges and [ab]uses tags like branches in weird way. And it's way harder to revert things if it comes down to that. In short, if you need a semi-waterfall, less devops-ish, release process, the dev branch can assist that.

Engineers prompt the LLM with \"add pagination to the list endpoint\" and get working code that ignores the existing query builder patterns, duplicates filtering logic, or misses the caching layer entirely.\nWhat I tell people: the research.md isn't busywork, it's your verification that the LLM actually understands the system it's about to modify.

I wrote a tool[1] that helps me make sure (for the npm ecosystem) my dependency specifications aren't over-wide.\nFor an application, you just want pinned specific dependencies. Renovate has a nice feature wherein it'll maintain transitive dependencies, so you can avoid the trap of only upgrading when forced to by more direct dependencies.\nThe net result is that most version bumps for my library code only affect the test environment, so I'm happy allowing them through if the tests pass. For application code, too, my personal projects will merge version bumps and redeploy automatically -- I only need to review if something breaks. This matches the implicit behaviour I see from most teams anyway, who rely on \"manual review\" but only actually succeed in adding toil.\nMy experience is that Renovate's lock file maintenance makes update a whole load safer than the common pattern of having ancient versions of most transitive dependencies then upgrading a thread of packages depended on by a newer version of a single dependency.\n1: https://www.npmjs.com/package/downgrade-build https://www.npmjs.com/package/downgrade-build",

If something crashes, the supervisor restarts it. No systemd, no cron, just the runtime doing what it was designed for.\nThe self-hosting path is great for tinkering — and Karpathy's point about NanoClaw's ~4000 lines being auditable is a solid trust argument. But once you want 24/7 uptime across multiple agents, you end up rebuilding production infrastructure from scratch.\nI run 5 Elixir apps on Fly for under €50/month, so the economics of multi-tenant hosting work well here.\n(Founder of OpenClawCloud — clawdcloud.net — happy to talk architecture if anyone's exploring this space.)",

And that's one of the big advantages, in my opinion, of using a voice to text app is that it would let you ramble and rant and see what you have said and keep making additions and alterations to that. For instance, I'm doing this entire bit using handy in one stream of thought take.

And I'm talking quite a bit so that I can actually put the system under stress and see how well it responds.\nMy only issue with it was that it cut off the words [I'm using] at the beginning and obviously it doesn't enter paragraph breaks.

I understand that today people know more contacts with email addresses than XMPP addresses, but if we ever want to free ourselves from the current walled gardens, we need to stop treating chat as something that only happens in walled gardens.\nSome people get worried about the idea of \"federation\", thinking that it somehow means their server is less private, and their data is being spread across a mesh of servers, and stuff like that. That's true in some decentralized/distributed chat protocols, but not in XMPP. Connections between servers only happen on-demand, similar how when you send email between different email providers, they will connect to each other to deliver the messages.\nHowever we do have a feature which allows disabling federation access for specific accounts, for example to prevent kids from communicating with anyone outside their own Snikket server. This is a feature I want to expand on, so that you can permit communication with a limited number of approved contacts on other servers.",

I got to interact with those older database systems and install and export/import data to systems running on eg Oracle across parallel Solaris servers at SAAB Areospace and Windows NT running on DEC Alpha at Ericsson, among other more vanilla deployments.\nI was a developer albeit not professionally, and my boss gave me the opportunity to develop the integration between Agresso and Crystal Reports, my first professional development project, for which I am still grateful. It was a DLL written in C++ and I imagine they shipped that for quite a while after I left for greener pastures.\nI was already a free software and Linux enthusiast, so I did a vain skunkworks attempt at getting Agresso to run with MySQL, which failed, but my Linux server in the office came in handy when I needed some extra software in the field--I asked a colleague to put a CD in the server so I could download it to the client site some 500 km away, and deliver on the migration.",

Language with more examples, shorter tokens, popularity, etc - doesn't matter at all if the codebase is a mess.\nFunctional languages like Elixir make it very easy to build highly structured applications. Each fn takes in a thing and returns another. Side effects? What side effects? LLMs can follow this function composition pattern all day long. There's less complexity, objectively.\nBut take languages that are less disciplined. Throw in arbitrary side effects and hidden control flow and mutable state ... the LLM will fail to find an obviously correct pattern and guess wildly. In practice, this makes logical bugs much more likely. Millions of examples don't help if your codebase is a swamp. And languages without said discipline often end up in a swamp.",

Especially if you're using malloc it's especially bad. We used jemalloc for a while which helped since it allocates memory better for multithreaded applications, but easiest is to just create a process.\nI don't know how memory intensive ML is, what generally screwed us over was image processing (ImageMagick and its many memory leaks) and... large CSV files.

Elixir makes it easy to write state machines which reason about different types of failures, but it’s more declarative (this process requires X and Y preconditions, otherwise do Z) rather than imperative (I have to try/catch failures due to X and Y, now do Z). With Elixir you can actually specify that the process doesn’t start until the DB connection is ready, if that was the cause of the failure, it won’t start again (something else can take care of the DB). When the LLM API returns an error you can put the agent in a paused “errored” state and then you can have a different process decide what to do with the error, and pass it back to the main agent when it’s done.

In Elixir you can do both: heavy CPU work without worrying about stopping the world, and heavy concurrency across millions of threads where work is I/O bound and you want to saturate your network connection.

API calls are constantly failing, timing out, retrying, and being pre/post processed, and you need to keep track of the state of your agent across multiple failure modes, recover gracefully, and coordinate between processes. In most other languages like Python or TypeScript that’s a hell of a lot of process orchestration code (Bull/Celery), try/catches, health checks, retry logic, and global state management in a a database of some sort. Compare that to Elixir processes where you get most of that for free because the language was designed exactly for that. It’s just a state machine that can crash and recover gracefully in the right order with all related processes. The BEAM is not just about running millions of processes at scale. It’s also about simplifying how you reason about a single process lifecycle, and long running agent lifecycles can get really complex.\nWhen you are just “gluing together API calls” surrounding tooling doesn’t matter as much. I don’t care that Elixir doesn’t have such a large community as Python, I’m just gluing together API calls, I don’t have dependencies.",

When you see good clothing in a game, it was probably created with Marvelous Designer.\nThen Clo exports a file for fabric cutting compliant with the ASTM D6673-10 standard, Standard Practice for Sewn Pattern Data Interchange, which is used for the production of garment patterns. It's kind of clunky, being based on Autodesk DXF, AutoCAD's export format from the 1980s, but it's what the industry uses. You can bring such files into anything that reads DXF and view them. So a widely used formal descriptive language for fabric cutting already exists.

Because of this, Tempus-Word NG can handle documents with more than 1000 pages with almost the same speed that it does with one with ten pages. The number of pages and speed are only limited by the available memory and processor speed. To achieve good results, you should use an ATARI with minimum 8 MB memory and 16 MHz, PC with 300 MHz and 64 MB, or comparable Mac. If you want to use huge dictionaries or many images, more memory is always useful.\" \nDoes anyone know what data structure? Why not use it in modern word processors?\nThe other features are impressive too:\n* Tempus-Word NG is based on a frame orientated layout similar to DTP programs. But contrasted to the usual method of “draw frame - connect frames - flow text” you create a general frame layout that is used automatically during text input. The positions of all layed-out frames is repeated automatically on all pages with this layout. You can create as many layouts as you want.\n* Integrated Database\n* Document manager\n* Page numbering of Contents and Index listings are always up to date.",

The top Google result is the MathWorld page [1] but it's very brief.\nHere how that pdf describes it. It first defines the perpendicular operator on a 2D vector x as\n x⟂ := (-x_2, x_1)\n \nwhich is x rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise. Then the perp dot product of two 2D vectors is defined as\n x⟂ . y\n \nThis has a few interesting properties, most notably that\n x⟂ . y = |x| |y| sin θ\n \nFor example, the sign of the perp dot product tells you whether you need to rotate clockwise or anticlockwise to get from x to y. If it's zero then they're parallel – could be pointing in same or opposite directions (or over or both are zero).\nIn this Reddit post [2] about it, again not much is said, but a redditor makes the astute observation:\n> The perp dot product is the same as the cross product of vectors in a plane, except that you take the magnitude of the z component and ignore the x/y components (which are 0).\n[1] http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerpDotProduct.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerpDotProduct.html \n[2] https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/agfm8g/what_is_perp_dot_product/ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/agfm8g/what_is_p...",

We don't write a lot of tests for example, and we often don't do much testing before we ship releases. Instead we test exhaustively after we ship releases, which is the only way we know of knowing for sure that the product we shipped does what we think it does. [...] We also don't (usually) practice TDD. If you look at the number of tests we have, it likely won't seem like it's anywhere near enough to keep a project of this size stable! The secret sauce here is that our key invariants aren't written in our test files, they're baked into the core of the implementation. Every time you use the code, you're essentially testing it. To gain confidence in our core, we simply try to use it to do a lot of real work.\nMan, why did i not think of that, i could have got out of writing so many tests if i'd just baked the invariants into the core of the implementation!",

Phones will usually do anywhere from 120-240Hz. Set up the camera so it can see both your input (e.g. a side view of you pushing a button) and the display, record a video, and then pull it into a media player that supports frame-by-frame playback. You can then measure the number of frames elapsed from you pushing the button (pressing it down far enough to electrically activate it) and the corresponding reaction on screen. This gives you a cheap and easy setup capable of measuring latency down to ~4ms granularity, and doing a few repeated measurements can give you a very accurate picture of latency. Keep in mind that latency is a range (statistical distribution), not a single number, so you need repeated measurements to understand the shape of the distribution.\nIf you’re developing a game, you can add a prominent frame counter on screen to be captured on the video, and add the frame counter to your log output. Then you can match up the video with your game’s events, after accounting for display latency.",

If binaries always only read stdin and wrote to stdout, we wouldn't need sandboxes – they would be pure functions.\nIn the real world, though, binaries usually have side effects and I really wish we could control those in a more fine-grained manner. Ideally, binaries couldn't just do anything by default but actually had to declare all their side effects (i.e. accessing env variables, config, state, cache, logs, DBUS/Xserver/Wayland sockets, user data, shared libraries, system state, …), so that I could easily put them in a sandbox that's tailored to them.\nConversely, I'm waiting for the day when algebraic effects are so common in programming languages that I can safely execute an untrusted JavaScript function because I have tight control over what side effects it can trigger.",

I can run you through a couple simpler versions of the system, why they don't work, and how that informs our ultimate design.\nThe most basic part of the system is \"two layers\". Layer 1 is the \"ground truth\" of the conversation - the whole text the user sees. Layer 2 is what the model sees, i.e., the active context window.\nIn a perfect world, those would be the same thing. But, as you know, context lengths aren't long enough for that, so we can't fit everything from Layer 1 into Layer 2.\nSo instead we keep a \"pointer\" to the appropriate part of Layer 1 in Layer 2. That pointer takes the form of a summary. But it's not a summary designed to contain all information. It's more like a \"label\" that makes sure the model knows where to look.\nThe naive version of the system would allow the main model to expand Layer 2 summaries by importing all of the underlying data from Layer 1. But this doesn't work well, because then you just end up re-filling the Layer 2 context window.\nSo instead you let the main model clone itself, the clone expands the summary in its context (and can do this for multiple summaries, transforming each into the original uncompressed text), and then the clone returns whatever information the main thread requires.\nWhere this system would not fully match the capabilities of RLMs is that, by writing a script that calls itself e.g. thousands of times, an RLM has the ability to make man",

LLMs kept trying to give me code patterns that would make sense for high level code but not really for assembly because by hand one could find much more optimized solutions there.\nBut coincidentally this seems like an easy win for generated training data. Take all your code and have a compiler spit out assembly as well as binary. Now your LLM will not only be able to be a compiler but also make that useful and understandable by humans.",

The result might not be idiomatic in the target language, but the bugs tend to be a bit fewer and shallower, and it assists with debugging the unfamiliar code when there are bugs - careful side-by-side comparison will make the mistakes clear even when I don't actually yet grok what the code is doing .\nThat's not to say that the code should be left in such a state permanently, but I'll note there's significantly more changes in function structure than I'd personally put into an initial C-to-Rust rewrite.\nThe author of this rewrite appears to be taking a different approach, understanding the codebase in detail and porting it bit by bit, refactoring at least some along the way.

While this is OK in e.g., GoLang, it is quite annoying in TypeScript. First, because of the more powerful type system (it's easier to guess that updated_at is a date than it is to guess whether it's nullable or not), second, because of idiosyncrasies (INT4s are deserialised as JS numbers, but INT8s are deserialised as strings).\nSo I wrote pg-typesafe, with the goal of it being the less burdensome: you call queries exactly the same way as you would call node-pg, and they are fully typed.\nIt's very new, but I'm already using it in a large-ish project, where it found several bugs and footguns, and also allowed me to remove many manual type definitions.",

I know that's why some frown on this template-based auto-placeholders because they want the code to better resemble the queries as they run in Postgres.\n(Also yeah, it might be nice if Postgres also supported named placeholders like some of the other SQL databases do.)",

They are historically contemporary and they are separated by a multiple of 72 degrees. Angkor Wat and (TODO a number of other ancient facilities) perhaps coincidentally are also on a geographic pentagon at 72° degrees.\nUnfortunately, due to TODO some sort of procession you would expect such a LF/VLF comm net to be off by about 1° after 72 years though? Perhaps this is part of why they built new temples etc. adjacent to older sites. The Temple of Seti is built adjacent to the Osireon, for example.\nAnyways, the scalloped marks on the walls of Longyou caves very likely operate as LF/VLF diffusers for local and far away signals that propagate TTE Through-the-Earth and also through water and hydrogen.\nAt 21cm, the northern Star Shaft in the Great Pyramid waveguides 1420 MHz. 1420 MHz is the fundamental frequency of Hydrogen.\nThe star shaft contain 0.25\" copper rods that would have been deoxidized by hydrogen. The star shafts were enclosed. People have speculated that they were for ventilation, but the star shafts were found sealed with the oxidized copper rods inside.\nThat copper could have been from the Great Lakes back then.\nWhy would you add copper rods to the tallest structure around in the desert, in shafts that would accumulate hydrogen if the structure was filled with water that foams as it drains out?\nAre those antennae and/or ionospheri",

So I said screw it and built exactly what I wanted.\ntori is a single go binary that runs on your server, reads host metrics from /proc and /sys, monitors containers via the docker socket (read-only), tails logs, and stores everything in sqlite with a 7 day retention.

It sits next to the hardware, owns the serial console, exposes access over SSH, and serves boot artifacts (kernel, initramfs, rootfs) via TFTP/HTTP. It’s designed for the phase where networking is unreliable, storage is half-flashed, and UART is the only thing still telling the truth.\nWhat it does\n- Serial console ownership + SSH multiplexing\n- Monitor shell + serial tunnels\n- Scriptable boot interaction\n- Artifact provisioning (TFTP + HTTP)\n- In-band file transfer over serial\n- gzip/base64 hacks + XMODEM\n- Derived from my earlier send_console-ng utility https://github.com/alessandrocarminati/send_file-ng https://github.com/alessandrocarminati/send_file-ng \n- Pluggable power control\n- SNMP PDUs, among others cheap ESP8266/Tasmota devices\n- Serial logging\n- Lightweight access control\nProvisioner also embeds a minimal init runtime (goinit) inside the kernel initramfs, acting as its on-board provisioning agent, handling flashing, artifact retrieval, and reporting management state back over serial.\nRouting & stream handling\nInternally, Provisioner routes serial traffic through a pluggable router:\n- Producers/consumers attach as components\n- Human vs machine clients handled differently\n- Unicast control sessions\n- Broadcast multiplexing to multiple observers\nThis allows several users or services to watch the same console without interfering.\nFilters\nA filter subsystem can intercept and modify serial streams on the fly.\nOriginally added to mitigate ANSI Device Status Reports (e.g. Cursor Position Report issues) when tunneling serial consoles, but it doubles as a general stream rewriting mechanism for automation and normalization.\nPositioning\nNot trying to replace large systems like LAVA.\nThis is aimed at:\n- Homelabs\n- Bring-up benches\n- Kernel/BSP work\n- Small shared labs\nThink lab automation you can deploy in an afternoon, not fleet orchestration.\nProject is still evolving but already in daily use.

      "body_text": "Telescope originally started as a ClickHouse-focused log viewer.\nBut while building it, I kept running into the same pattern: when everything worked, logs were in ClickHouse. When things broke, logs were still inside Kubernetes.\nThat gap led to adding Kubernetes as a native log source.\nThis is not meant to replace proper log aggregation. Centralized storage with indexing and retention policies is still the right approach for production.\nBut there are situations where aggregation doesn't help: the logging pipeline is broken, logs are delayed, or you're debugging locally and don't have a pipeline at all.\nIn those cases, the logs are already in the pods. The usual fallback is kubectl logs (or stern), often across multiple terminals and namespaces. It works, but correlation becomes manual.\nTelescope can now query logs directly from Kubernetes clusters via the Kubernetes API. It lets you query across multiple namespaces and clusters, filter by labels and fields, apply time ranges, normalize severity across different log formats, and visualize log volume over time.\nIt uses your existing kubeconfig, fetches logs in parallel (configurable concurrency), and uses time filters to limit data transfer from Kubernetes APIs.\nNo agents. No CRDs. No cluster changes.\nCurrent limitations: no streaming / follow mode yet.\nCurious if others have run into the same \"pipeline gap\" problem - when logs aren't in your backend yet, but you still need structured access to them.\nGitHub: https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope https://github.com/iamtelescope/telescope \nChangelog: https://docs.iamtelescope.net/changelog https://docs.iamtelescope.net/changelog",

If you press \"s\", it will save the complete history to a JSON file (a timeline of the parameters that were changed at given ticks), so you can replay it and regenerate the discovery.\nYou can pan/zoom, and while the main simulation window is in focus, the arrow keys can be used to update parameters (which are shown in the TUI).\nClaude deserves all the credit and criticism for any technical elements of this project (beyond rough guidelines). I've just always wanted something like this, and it's a lot of fun to play with. Who needs video games these days.",

A council of DeepSeek-R1 + llama2-uncensored + mistral-nemo is a \nvery different deliberation than GPT-4o + Claude + Gemini.\n*Zero server, zero account, zero storage.* The app is purely static. \nAPI calls go directly from your browser to providers. Nothing touches a \nbackend. No tokens, no sessions, no analytics. Your API keys never leave \nyour machine.\n*Runs on your own hardware.* If you have Ollama, you can run an entire \ncouncil locally for free. I use a 5-member all-Ollama setup on an RTX 2070 \n(8GB VRAM) — sequential requests, slow, but completely private.\nThe deliberation process is 3 stages:\n1. All members answer independently\n2. Each member critiques anonymized responses from the others \n3. A designated Chairman synthesizes a final verdict\nA few things I found genuinely interesting:\n- Reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, QwQ) emit <think> blocks mid-stream. \n Stripping these while showing a \" Thinking…\" indicator keeps the UX \n clean without losing answer quality.\n- The Contrarian persona on an uncensored model produces meaningfully \n different critiques than a safety-tuned model playing the same role.\n- Peer review across models catches blind spots that a single model \n arguing with itself won't surface.\nGitHub: https://github.com/prijak/Ai-council.git https://github.com/prijak/Ai-council.git",

It made it 8x faster in some cases.\nHowever, it was not optimal to use it:\n- OpenSSL is heavy and bloated. It's like a whole operating system on its own.\n- Since OpenSSL 3.0, low-level digest APIs are deprecated, and instead they recommend to use EVP which might be slow in some cases.\nSo I decided to create a new library for computing cryptographic digests. It basically takes OpenSSL's implementations, but with an aim to provide simple and lightweight access to popular hash algorithms with a focus on performance.",

If the script encounters any new ASINs, it stores them for future checks, so the list of golf balls being price checked should keep growing over time. Changes are then pushed to Cloudflare pages.\nThere can sometimes be some pricing oddities when the product title says one count, but the unit count being returned from Amazon is another number, so I'm trying to add some checks to help accommodate for that. Right now, I just have some manual overrides for certain ASINs, but I'm looking to improve on it in the future.\nThe frontend is just some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nListings on Amazon can be inconsistent sometimes because, for example, product titles will say used balls, but the seller lists them as new. I added some filters to that allow you to exclude used/recycled balls, plastic golf balls, etc... You can also filter by brand.\nGive it a spin and let me know if you run into any issues or have any feature ideas to make it more useful.",

It seems totally reasonable to me that Google doesn't want to invest a lot of resources into making an extremely small minority happy.

Just because China is second in GDP and is a behemoth in various sectors (and clearly way ahead, in comparison to US in some of the sectors), it is still clearly not on the same level as USA both economically or militarily. Despite that, China does not apply a blanket tariff on all nations of the World. It is more targeted and specific to sectors where it feels the other nation can endanger it. Heck, it can even remove tariffs if it feels domestic production is more expensive. For example, China removed 30% import duty on Indian pharma sector because domestic production of the same generic as well as branded drugs was more expensive.\nThe higher you are in the economic ladder, it is only beneficial for you to reduce your tariffs. Because of two simple points:\n1. You being higher in the economic ladder implies you have higher disposable income. That means your citizens can buy produce/services at cheaper rates from those below the ladder.\n2. Lower/zero tariffs ensures no brakes on spending.\nIf you increase tariffs, you are going to reduce the disposable income of your own citizens. Because those tariffs are borne by the citizens.

Perhaps Apple but that's not a pc and you won't run qubes on that?\n- physical anti-tamper: which laptops wipe encryption keys stored in the secure hardware when you're trying to unlock the bootloader?\n- physical memory tagging (see ARM MTE). Apple offers some but again, that's not for qubes. Intel promises MKTME in the future.\n- does your laptop disable all the unconnected ports whilst the laptop is broken? Does your pin/password verification happen inside TEE/TPM, not in the OS?\n- modes similar to PXN/SMEP, SMAP/PAN (to stop these pesky wifi/gpu firmware from reading userpace memory).

I'll focus on the small things that compound and I think this makes the start a little slower but that makes things accelerate as my base isn't shaky as I'm moving forward.\nBut this also helps when I've doing things like learn a language. It's why I wrote the last paragraph like I did. The science side gives you the habit of breaking things down into their atomic units. The framework of build, attack/critique/deconstruct, rebuild. When I was younger I couldn't do this. If I were trying to do something like learn Chinese I'd first focus on just memorizing rather than focus on the radicals.\nThe iterative style of building up is such a useful framework. Naturally when forming a hypothesis you try to build something stable. But the most important thing to then do is attack it as hard as you can. This is a step most people don't take, but it's probably the most important one for finding truth. It damages and even sometimes completely destroys your construction. But when you rebuild it is better, it is stronger. The framework taught me the importance of doing the boring stuff like revisiting what I've already learned.\nAnd that's also why I'm saying there's ",

The sheer act of accessing information not intended for publication, which is the main issue here, if data was not deleted, is more akin to eavesdropping than to stealing.\n> Now, if you're instead an employee of that company, and have access to their customer data (you're holding it), would you then agree that making a copy and selling it to somebody else, would be stealing?\nI'd say the same. Not really stealing. More like violating an agreement about the borrowed data. The crime doesn't stem from the nature of data or ownership but rather from violating signed agreement about keeping borrowed, private data to yourself. If no agreement was made or the agreement contained unlawful clauses, no crime.\n> Or consider if you rent a VHS tape, does that give you ownership of the movie, and let you copy it as you want?\nSince the movie is out, the information is no longer private. So requiring me to keep the movie to myself might be and example of what should be an unlawful clause in data borrowing agreements.

But later on, you're invited to re-interpret that statement as being about people: computers and technology were the thing that got the main characters to work together. It's the -people- that are the thing.\nPart of what makes the show so good is that it's one of the few renditions in TV / movies of the joy of engineering something, and the constant tension that comes from working with great people. Great people inspire you, but they also challenge you. The show does a great job of portraying realistic conflicts that arise between different personality types and roles, as well as cleverly exposing the limitations of those personalities. With just Gordon, you'll get a stable and well engineered product but it won't be revolutionary. Joe has the vision but he can't actually _do_ the substantive part. Cameron has great substance and technical ability, but she's impractical and inflexible. Donna is responsible, effective, and clear-eyed - but unchecked, purely rational decisions erode the soul of a company into nothing.

Trying to see if you are formulating your position as a creator or a consumer.\nIf the latter, hate to say it, but your opinion is kind of irrelevant. Ultimately, only artists really understand what's involved in creating real art. Not what's good or bad, but what's at stake and how to tell if somebody's for real.\nIf you're a creator I'm a little puzzled. Are you really worried that AI is so freaking great that the horrible luddites at bandcamp et al are going to \"gatekeep\" us away from incredible AI art?

For the latter two, people who actually write m and not т will often resolve the ambiguity with ш with an over- resp. underbar (the same ones that Serbian uses even in print[1]). It’s also pretty normal to exaggerate letter joins when they come out looking too similar to parts of other letters, etc. Overall, modern Russian cursive is about as legible as the modern French one, and I don’t think people complain much about the latter.\nI also find the hand-wringing about English accents somewhat surprising. Yes, different accents exist, and yes, English has a much wider variation than (urban) Russian (there are things in the countryside that urban dwellers haven’t heard for a century), but phonemic orthographies are a thing, and though children in e.g. Moscow may perpetually struggle with orthographic distinctions that no longer correspond to anything in their accent, the idea of a spelling competition remains about as laughable as that of a shoelace-tying one. Nobody makes you represent the many mergers of English with a single letter in your new orthography (though it would be funny).\n[1] https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cyrill",

An *apparent DDoS* launched from archive.today’s CAPTCHA page against his blog.\n3. *Threats* from the archive.today operator (“Nora”) to associate Patokallio’s name with AI porn and other harassment.\n4. *Discovery that archive.today had altered archived pages* to insert Patokallio’s name.\n5. A *Wikipedia RfC* and decision to deprecate and blacklist archive.today links.\nThe Hacker News thread you referenced is about the final step: Wikipedia’s decision to remove ~695,000 archive.today links.\n---\n## 2.

The article provides very little to go on, and it is not hard to imagine that an abuser who is clever enough to publish CSAM material online for years without getting caught is clever enough to keep the abuse hidden from the mother and manipulate a child into keeping their trauma secret.\n> (Not necessarily every step and every breath of the kid, but you know the large stuff, like for example are they being sexually abused.) \nThere are vast numbers of parents who do not find out for years[2]:\n 73% of child victims do not tell anyone\n about the abuse for at least a year.\n 45% of victims do not tell anyone for\n at least 5 years. Some never disclose.\n \nGiven how often sexual abuse happens, we're talking about millions of parents. I do not believe that every last one of them is morally culpable because they did not \"know the large stuff, like for example are [their children] being sexually abused\" and that they should be criminally charged.\n[1] https://mitchellhamline.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2012/01/Fatal-D",

This guy was reported exposing and \"playing with\" himself on the order of dozens of times with nonconsensual partners, so it's likely that it's happened hundreds of times.\nI don't think this is socially acceptable behavior in 'normal' society. And in response to his deciding to visibly 'rub one off' (as I believe this term is what results in auto-flagging) towards his neighbor, his response is that she was a \"trigger\" for him. So he himself is already claiming that he can't control himself, which is more less the entire point of such registries. Imagine you have daughters, let alone a wife. Would you want to live across the street from such a person?\nAnd again I'd emphasize he actually got removed from the registry. So imagine the sort of behavior required to stay on one.

I’m specifically talking about this case.\nUnpredictable random acts of violence happen. Would be lunacy to punish the parents for that. On the other end of the scale here we are talking about abuse ongoing for years. By someone who the mother brought into the child’s life. Somewhere between those two ends of the scale i run out of sympathy for the excuse of “she didn’t know”. Where exactly the bundary is I don’t know. What i know is that in the scenairo described in the article i strongly believe we are in the “she should have known” territory.\nThink it through. Do you think that the kid who was praying for someone to come help her, and for whom the law enforcement officers were sufficiently concerned about that they started learning brick manufacturing, do you think that kid was not at least a little bit off? You know, just enough for their mum’s to become concerned and start looking for an explanation?\nYou call what i say monstrous cruelty. I tell you what i think is monstrous cruelty: no kid, ever, in the history of humankind has ever had the opportunity to consent to being born. Giving life to a kid is a choice. Especially in this day and age. By choosing to father a kid or give birth to a kid one becomes responsible for the wellbeing of said kid. How far and how deep that responsibility goes can be debated.

If you actually watch the part of the original video the image was taken from, you quickly realize the woman in question just has the misfortune of having very naturally emotive facial expressions and the still is taken from an argument between her and a Trump supporter about the alleged concern of immigrant sex abusers and that if you consider the fact they have to yell at each other to overcome the noisy environment she doesn't actually appear at all outraged or angry.\nI don't explain this to dunk on the channel - it easily does that by itself. I explain this because the fact that the channel you cited a video from uses this meme in 2026 (10 years after it was first taken, i.e. enough time to learn about its origin and move on) is extremely symbolic of the approach you seem to favor for finding explanations to social phenomena. Yes, \"it's just a meme\", but that's the point: memes are shorthands that carry cultural context (or in this case entire fossil records of cultural history), they're not just funny pictures.\n_That_ isn't \"what we evolved to like\". \"Men\" aren't \"probably worse\".

It's difficult to grasp given how much our culture tends to conflate them as desirable traits in men but the main distinction is that one is about resilience and the other is about abuse.\nConfidence is attractive. Unless you're deeply insecure (and abusers often are insecure even if they try to mask it in displays of dominance) you're likely attracted to confidence in potential partners - yes, even as a straight guy. Just like an insecure person can use dominance to mask their insecurity, a confident person can also act submissively. This isn't just true in BDSM, it's actually a social dynamic many people engage in completely naturally.\nAn abuser (or I guess the pop-psych term is usually \"narcissist\" but let's not open the can of worms on whether that is ever applied \"correctly\") will often seek out a confident partner they can manipulate into a position of vulnerability they can take advantage of to control them.\nThe problem with power is that it is nearly inseparable from abuse. Abuse will inevitable arise from any power imbalance because the mere circumstance of being in a position of power can easily lead to absuses of power unless you're extremely diligent about your use of it.

Being incarcerated literally limits the potential for abuse and especially violent abuse which further contributes to an illusion of safety and control which the abuser can take advantage of by engaging in psychological manipulation tactics like lovebombing.\nYou don't have to subscribe to pseudoscientific explanations like evopsych or some inherent trait in women making them naturally predisposed to seeking out people who harm them in order to figure out what can cause these phenomena. In fact, I find just-so \"explanations\" (like you seem to imply by pointing at a term like this as if it in itself holds explanatory power) extremely unsatisfying because they're little more than thought-terminating clichés.\nIt's also worth pointing out the term was coined by the guy who is best known for promoting chemical castration (which aside from having motivated Alan Turing to take his own life is still a contested issue in the scientific community due to studies showing serious side-effects and the efficacy ",

Intermittent receive could be used instead.\nWhether that's more efficient or not is an interesting problem.\nTransmitters tend to use more instantaneous power (ie, Watts) than receivers do, but a transmission can be very, very short.

Transmitter wakes up, blurts out what it has to say, and goes back to sleep.\nIf a chunk of BLE data of this size takes 1ms of transmit time (it might), and it happens every 60 seconds (it might), then that's transmitting for 1.44 seconds per day.\nSo total consumed power over time (ie, Joules per day, or whatever) can be very low. That's part of how we got here -- BLE is built around this concept, and it all converges to make this easy to accomplish.\nMeanwhile: An intermittent receiver tends to use less instantaneous power, but it usually needs to operate for a longer period.

I suppose you could take the position that the industrialists who capitulated to the Nazis (I mean, those who didn't actively support them to begin with) were more at fault than the Nazis. Personally, I don't believe that.\nAnd to be clear, I'm not saying fiduciary duty requires capitulation. CEOs can absolutely make the case that resistance serves long-term shareholder interests, and the evidence backs them up. Costco is thriving after, and arguably because, they held firm on DEI. Target capitulated and lost $12.5 billion in market value and its CEO resigned. I started shopping at Costco for this reason and haven't been in a Target since Trump took office, after shopping their regularly. What I am saying is that the short-term incentive structure of public companies makes capitulation easier , which is exactly why the coercion works so well and why it's the bigger problem. The system erects hurdles to doing what's right, and often what's even in a company's own long-term interest.",

Famously, China silenced one of the very first COVID reporters and forced him to recant, before he himself died from the virus.[1]\nAs the pandemic wore on, we began to see a fight over \"fact-checking\". Mostly, it played out on Facebook and YouTube, not in traditional media. At the height, I saw a lot of channels self-censoring by avoiding any mention of the words \"COVID\", \"virus\", \"coronavirus\" etc to avoid the AI bot that would capriciously ban or demonetize their videos because it clocked them as COVID misinformation, even when they weren't primarily talking about the virus or proposing any sort of false, harmful, or misleading takes. Many channels do similar today, saying \"PDF files\" instead of pedophiles or \"SA\" / \"Sea Ess Eh Em\" instead of \"sexual assault\" or \"kiddy porn\" while talking about the Epstein files. Or everyone's favorite, \"unalive\" or \"self-delete\" instead of \"dead\"/\"kill\" or \"suicide\".\nI don't have a good source for most of that handy - I just remember living through it.

Which is a _goofy_ position to have, if you are a billionaire, or even a millionaire. Like, if property theft is perfectly acceptable, and if they own most of the property (intellectual or otherwise), then there can only be _upside_ for less fortunate people like us.\nThe implicit motto of this class of hyper-wealthy people is: \"it's not yours if you cannot keep it\". Well, game on.\n(There are 56.5e6 millionaires, and 3e3 billionaires -- making them 0.7% of the global population. They are outnumbered 141.6 to 1. And they seem to reside and physically congregate in a handful of places around the world. They probably wouldn't even notice that their property is being stolen, and even if they did, a simple cycle of theft and recovery would probably drive them into debt).",

I expect the term will die in some time as Claude Code equivalent becomes more popular, but right now I do find it pretty frustrating.\nI do have a bunch of project prototypes done from scratch using Claude Code to explore ideas that I would qualify as vibe coded, but also some other projects that are done ~99% with Claude Code (I mean, the implementation, the design is mine), started as very scrappy prototypes, and evolved to something that is best in class in their specific somewhat niche domains (for things where I have expertise and feel confident I can judge). It's good software, reliable, strong focus on user experience, tested in prod, based on a few years of thinking what would actually fix once and for all a common issue in my niche at work. That's what makes me ask: at what point do you drop the vibe coded term?\nIt's not really about my personal perception of the project's value, more like... the idea that great software is rejected because it was written by an agent.\nPS: congrats on sticking to your project for 5y, wishing you the best :)",

Under certain circumstances (eg. always ipv4 NAT/double-NAT, never for ipv6) their Tailscale client couldn't establish a direct connection to the Tailscale node in the datacenter, so data was relayed through Tailscales public relay nodes. Which at times was rate limited/bottleneck - in all fairness, that is to be expected according to their docs.\nThe first mitigation was to \"ban\" the specific public relay they were using in the policy. Which helped, but still not a great solution and we might just end up in a weird whack-a-mole-ish ban game with the public peer relays in the long run.\nSo we setup a peer relay, which networking-wise is in a DMZ sort of network (more open), but location wise still in the datacenter and allowed it to easily reach the internal (more restricted networking) Tailscale nodes. Which solved all throughput problems, since we no longer have users connecting through the public relays.\nAlso, the peer relays feels a little bit magic, once you allow the use of them in the Tailscale policy, it just works(tm) - there is basically zero fiddling with them.\nEDIT: I'll happily provide more details if interested - we did a fair amount of testing and debugging along the way :)",

I don't believe any are fanless, but most are quiet - Lunar Lake gen 3 is an SOC with a base TDP of 25 watts, and it can even go down to 15 watts. These CPUs are slightly faster in multi-core performance than M4, and they use similar wattage. I believe the Asus zenbook duo gets better battery life by a wide margin because of the 99 watt-hour battery. They still fall a little short of M5 in performance, but it's very close.\nAs for servers, it's a good point.

You said that I am just argumentative for the sake of it, and that we can use deduction based on the incomplete evidence because it makes sense.\n> Yes? It's not a difficult concept that you can use pattern recognition to predict how someone, or something will behave. It works especially well the more moving parts there are. The more moving parts, the more likely you are to find conflicting bits. So in that case, if you want to predict or explain the root cause of the behavior, you're going to need to use heuristics.\nWhat does it even mean? How can you explain root cause of something with heuristics?\n> The point is, your demand for magical proof is a red herring, you can predict correctly without it. Thus it's useful to describe them by the way they behave.\nSure, lol. So, what do you do with other \"evidence\" that does not fit the prediction you are trying to make? You just discard it as \"error\"?\n> Technically, I guess you don't need to, you're arguments are a perfect counter example, about how you can just ignore the parts that make you feel icky, or conflict with what you assume you understand. Most people you talk to will not be able to perfectly explain the ideas they hold so if you want to learn what they might have to teach, you need to make some kind of attempt to engage with them, even if in the end you find you still disagree, you're very likely to learn something.

If you arrived at that point you almost have to exterminate other cultures - how could you allow something bad to poison and destroy the people? They could be saved by your obviously better culture! You would almost be a monster not “liberating” them!\nMaybe, maybe not. The same thing can be said about left as well, and we have a lot of examples in history how left ideologies were taken too far and millions of people had perished in the process: industrialization of USSR by Stalin, Mao's great leap, etc.\nSo, the bottom line is that extremes are bad.\n> Then just listen to the speeches and proclamations of your heads of state.

You are entitled to your opinion. What is strange to me is that Americans (and you as somebody from NZ) are starting to lecture us on that we are being censored by our government. Which in itself is ridiculous and even when explaining why we are preferring the rules we have, we get attacked for it.\nGermans aren't mentally conquered, this is just bullshit. We have the same freedom to think what we want as all other Europeans. Things are also evolving, the second world war is so long ago, that very few Europeans were first hand involved. What we considered American values (I don't think the Anglo sphere is very united in these) has also rapidly changed. Americans no longer believe in multi-lateralism and shared values, so not sure what reflection you are alluding to.\nYour views on the war are also not very informed. West Germany and East Germany were vastly differently handled by the occupation forces. While for East Germany your talking points of a total replacement it true, in West Germany many of the old elites had to be put back in power to aid the western allies in propping up Germany against the Russians.

Even as someone who understands the space very strongly, and has published several top-tier ML papers, I cannot help but to conclude the primary destination of the current tech sector and Silicon Valley is the ruthless exploitation of the rest of society.\nTaking a sober look at the state of software, we observe a few things.\nThe services offered by modern software to users, as a whole, have remained largely the same over the past ~5 years. The state of software quality is in rapid decline, with enshittification and rent-seeking running extraordinarily rampant. Software security has been in the same disaster-state it has been for the past 20 years, where software resilience is in stagnation, governments and private institutions stockpile vulnerabilities, and security researchers and auditors can consistently find new vulnerabilities. The rest of American society outside of the tech sector is currently facing a standards of living nosedive, and clearly they have not benefited from the tech sector's financial proliferation in the AI space.\nRealistically, I cannot help the feeling that we're headed towards a reality where the 4th amendment is dead, and machine learning models process everything about you to ultimately extract more from you.

A lot of the adverts even look the same.\nThat's not the product of migrants. SF is turning into a ghost town because the entire downtown area increasingly feels like the inside of a conference center. There isn't anything fun to do or places to go besides work, nothing that might appeal to youth, nothing that isn't business focused. Can you imagine being a teenager in SF? You go to the middle of town and every advert is just an elevator pitch for HR services or devops or model training, and most of the them aren't even visually interesting to look at. Entire subway stations are taken over with adverts touting how agentic or accelerant some new brand is. It's boring . A Japanese acquaintance of mine who visited SF recently asked 'don't people here think about anything but work?'\nHow you ended up blaming this humanity-free environment on 'too many migrants' is beyond me.",

One is on the \"low level\" to denote the specific action of taking the data and serializing it. The other one is \"high level\", where it's just a bag where you throw in anything related (serialization, deserialization, protocols, etc) - same as it's done on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization (note how the article is not called \"Serialization and deserialization\" for exactly these reasons). So yes, you can argue that the author could have written \"deserialization\", but you can also argue that the author used the \"high level\" interpretation of the word and therefore used it correctly.\nAs for insertion not happening and balancing stuff - my memory might be failing me, but I do remember it actually happening during serialization. I think there even was a \"delete\" option when constructing the \"serialized buffer\", but it had interesting limitations.\nAnyway, not sure how deep did you go into how it works (beyond what's in the article), but it's a pretty cool and clever piece of work (and yes, it does have its limitations, but also I can see this having its applications - e.g. when sending data from a more powerful machine to a tiny embedded one).",

But reading a statement like that makes folks think \"AI slop\", which would not be the case at all and would be insanely unfair towards the author. Even creating a scale of \"no AI was used at all\" → \"a bit was used\" → \"...\" wouldn't solve the misinterpretation issue, because regardless of how well we would define the scale, I have zero hope that more than a handful of people would ever read our definitions (and understand them the way we intended) posted somewhere on our website (or even in the zine itself).\nAnother example would be someone doing research for their article and using AI as a search engine (to get leads on what more to read on the topic). On one hand this is AI usage, on another it's pretty similar to just using a classical search engine. Yet still someone could argue that the article should be marked as \"being AI enhanced\".\nThere are also more popular use-cases for AIs, like just doing wordsmithing/polishing the language. A great majority of authors (including me) are not native English speakers, yet folks do want their articles to present well (some readers are pretty unforgiving when it comes to typos and grammar errors).

What truly do we know about the organization that produced the Claude desktop app, by virtue of the fact that they built it in electron?\nReally truly what do we know about them based on that decision? I submit the answer is basically nothing.\nInstead, we’re sort of coasting on priors and vibes about “native” tool kits being better. And that’s just catnip for people on the Internet who want to talk shit about code and don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about.\nIf native is a stand in for better in your mind and you conclude that they made a choice that was worse because it’s not native then therefore you can conclude that they are bad somehow. But the connective tissue there is not whatever they’re designing choice is (and of course we have no vision into the actual choices). It’s the un-investigated prior. That native is good and cross platform is bad. That’s really what people are arguing in this thread.\nAnd the only reason we don’t see that is completely fucking ridiculous is because we are also interested in talking about how AI is bad.\nSo everyone gets to have two bites of the cookie and nobody gets to defend an actual argument. It’s so silly that I don’t think that we can claim that the piece is actually much more moderate and subtle than everyone is reading it to be. Because that’s kind of a dastardly position too.

Emails are not uniform 128-bit values. They’re low-entropy, structured identifiers drawn from a predictable distribution.\nAttackers don’t search 2^128. They search realistic candidates.\nEmails are lowercase ASCII, structured as local@domain, domains come from a small known set, usernames follow common patterns, and massive breach corpora already exist. If you’ve ever used John/Hashcat, you know the whole game is shrinking the search space.\nGiven a large dataset of MD5(email): Precompute common emails, generate likely patterns, restrict by known domains, use leaked datasets, distributed GPU it. I.e, relatively cheap \nif the attacker already suspects a specific email, MD5 gives them a perfect equality test. That alone kills privacy.\nSo unsalted MD5(email) is not protection. It’s a stable public identifier that enables membership testing, cross-dataset linkage, re-ID, and doxxing.\nAcademic preimage resistance can still hold while real-world privacy absolutely does not.\nIt's not about breaking MD5’s math, but more about attack economics and low-entropy inputs. To your point, this problem exists with any bare hash. Salt slows large-scale precomputation, but it doesn’t magically add entropy to predictable identifiers.",

The replacing human drivers to save lives yada yada... That ain't it. The point is creating a handful of leverage points through which the autonomy of the populace to move wherever they want can be controlled through. Once the tech is the majority driver, people can finally be properly managed as the little work units they are. That's the dark part of the valuation. The power aspect. The ones who own the means to locomote are the ultimate rent collectors. There's simply no arguing that can be done by a populace that can be prevented from showing up to any attempt at collective protest via geofencing. Or if they do show up, can be added to a comprehensive list for participating in disruptive activities.\nCapabilities, ladies and gentlemen. We have to assess these things on the ground of what they enable. Delegating transport entirely to a third party necessarily creates a vulnerability of society to manipulation by the ones running the damn thing; and the ones running the damn thing want money, and security for themselves.",

The orbit isn't varying significantly, it's just not a whole number of day-night cycles which is inconvenient for us, but the spin actually varies. To \"fix\" this variation we have leap seconds.

What happens if I make a single \"simple\" printer for my own use that prints anything I tell it to because I \"simply\" didn't include any scanning or blocking functions in the printer design, and I never intend to print copy/counterfeit money? Is such a printer \"adapted to the making of\" counterfeit money? I don't know. If I instead make or transfer such a printer for any purpose other than my own personal use, the answer might move toward yes, but maybe it was already yes. Does the US require all copiers and printers to include at least one feature that prevents copying or counterfeiting of money?

Services are good and necessary. We just need to avoid using services that become corrupted by dark patterns, and to do that it will help if we can put guardrails in place to regulate services.\nThe example in the article about \"moving your email from gmail\" is nonsensical. Yes, you can have another email that can still (in theory) email all the same people. But if you don't actually have all your old emails, that will be pretty cold comfort. Not to mention that you may have difficulty convincing those people that you're the same person whose gmail got nuked. And that's assuming whatever new email provider you get is big enough that it won't be autoblocked by gmail, preventing all your old gmail friends from even seeing your emails.\nEmail being a protocol doesn't really help much here. What we need is to simply do regular \"maintenance\" of the tech world to ensure that individual providers do not become too big and powerful.",

The difference is I don't think merely moving somewhere should give you political representation there, and the corresponding benefits you would get. You would need to gain citizenship.\n\"Paying taxes\" has nothing to do with it. I pay taxes whenever I travel on anything I buy. I pay taxes when I export products. I don't magically get to vote or apply for social housing because of those taxes, because I'm not a citizen.\nBut I do have a place where I am a citizen, and if I'm upset about \"my taxes\" going to foreign political systems, get this, I can just choose to not pay them. No one is forcing me to travel or work in a foreign country or export products or pay taxes to people who don't represent me politically.\n---\nAs to \"anti-immigrant\", my position is straightforward: citizens of Country A should not be treated as if they were citizens of Country B merely by voluntarily \"paying taxes\" to Country B, for goods, labor, visas, exports, or any other reason. They must actually be a citizen of a country to get the benefit of being a citizen of that country.\nThis is a rule that applies to every country and all people, whether an immigrant or not: you get the benefits of citizenship when you are a citizen, and not a day before.\nThat's pro-citizenship, not anti-immigrant.

It’s whole point to give awareness about anything user wants to know, faster and more comprehensively than regular diaries, but focused on just what matters for an inquiry.\nFumes, in my understanding, wouldn’t have an idea of a “key” but only “that front door key on a silver keychain” or “smaller mailbox key with a deep scratch on the right side”.

Had to start again from scratch every time (or ADB). What's the point in collecting all that data when I couldn't usefully access any of it?\nSame thing with Google home, more or less.

RLHF and DPO reward policies optimize for the modal response given a prompt distribution. That is not a bug in the training process, it is the objective function working as designed. The model learns to produce the response that the median annotator would rate highest, and that response is, almost by definition, the least distinctive one.\nWhat is underappreciated is how much stylistic signal lives in what information retrieval people call \"burstiness\" -- the tendency for distinctive words to cluster rather than distribute evenly. Hemingway's short declarative stacking, DFW's recursive parentheticals, legal writing's formulaic precision -- these are all bursty patterns that a model trained to maximize expected reward will sand down. You can partially recover it with few-shot prompting, but the model is fighting its own reward gradient the entire time.\nThe practical question is whether you can encode a style prior that survives the decoding process. The research on authorship attribution (stylometry) suggests the feature set is well-understood -- function word frequencies, sentence length distributions, type-token ratios, syntactic complexity metrics. But nobody has built a production system that uses those features as a constraint during generation rather than just detection.",

And the protestors and rioters could have been trivially dispersed at any moment by the Capitol Police which not only has a force of thousands, but even has heavy equipment and gear enabling them to respond to even extreme things like an aerial attack on the Capitol. Instead they deployed a tiny fraction of their force with minimal equipment, and just watched things unfold, all while Twitter actively censored Trump saying things like:\n- \"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement.

Hell, just convincing Raffensperger to do what Trump wanted him to do would have also gotten him most of the way there.\nAnd yes, obviously part of the point of the EC is dealing with a smaller number of votes instead of every vote.

If nobody does, then the House of Representatives gets to determine who becomes President. And they came far closer to overturning the election than some guys rioting around the Capitol did, since there was a viable path towards the goal.\nYour perception of the electoral college is somewhat biased. The college itself serves a practical purpose - elections in the US are extremely decentralized by design. States can do pretty much whatever they want, only later constrained by various constitutional amendments. So when a state A gives you a number, that number does not necessarily mean the same thing as when state B does the same. The electoral college normalizes election results by requiring each state to convert their numbers into a common format. And instead of relying on the Federal government trying to deal with millions of votes, it's only 538.\nSimilarly, the scheme in support of Trump was not only not illegal, but even anticipated by the electoral count act which made it such that if the House/Senate disagreed with votes included or excluded by the Vice President, then they were free to overrule it by a simple majority vote. The VP's role was then later changed to a purely ceremonial one in a new law passed in 2022, largely to prevent this angle in the future.",

Hamilton, for example, wrote extensively of this in the federalist papers. This is explicitly one of the reasons why we have the electoral college at all, instead of a popular vote. If anything, I wish they had had the foresight to codify it in the Constitution or Bill of Rights so that states could not prevent it from happening.

I know many doctors from Korea, and their take on it was that Yoon's populist policy to increase caps on medical students wouldn't fix the actual issue at hand, which is that nobody wants to work in a low-paid, highly stressful environment. Unfortunately, those happen to be the exact fields of medicine that are lacking in doctors.\nIn fact, what they warned would happen is that it would just increase the number of new graduates heading towards highly lucrative, unregulated medical fields like dermatology and cosmetic surgery, and would only exacerbate the gaps in essential areas like pediatrics, OB/GYN, and emergency medicine, which face real shortages.\nThe root of the problem is twofold: First, South Korea's National Health Insurance heavily regulates and caps the prices for essential and lifesaving care, sometimes setting reimbursement rates so low that hospitals lose money on them. Meanwhile, non essential aesthetic procedures have no price caps.\nSecond, South Korea has an unusually high rate of prosecuting doctors criminally for medical malpractice. Doctors in high stakes environments like the ER or surgery face massive legal risks and the threat of actual prison time for unavoidable bad outcomes. Conversely, opening a skin clinic carries almost zero legal risk, no night shifts, and much higher pay.\nThe doctors' frustration was that Yoon's policy relied on a trickle down theory of medi",

This wasn't just a crowd shouting and throwing molotov cocktails.\nThe citizen militia systematically raided police stations, military reserve armories in surrounding towns.

By 20th, multiple people were beaten to death, and as people got angry protests became larger and larger.\nOn 21st, the street of Geumnam-ro was packed with tens of thousands of protestors. On 1 pm, soldiers opened fire on protestors, with more than 50 dying. That afternoon, people started organizing armed militia.\nThese are all very well known and publicly available information, a google search away for anyone who can read Korean.\nEnglish summary is also available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju_Uprising https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju_Uprising",

It's still not clear as to who fired the first shot and by all definitions can be viewed as armed insurrection not a mere \"public protest\".\nAlso during this time protests were spreading not just in Gwangju but in other large cities. The Gwangju incident is still a very contested and heavily debated historical event one that has been constantly politically weaponized to silence opposition.\n> So mock their later pardons if you want to, but you can't deny it marked an important and necessary step in Korea's history. It also shows sending your ex-presidents to prison only to pardon them later is still better than not bothering with it at all.\nI am mocking South Korea's political arena because pardoning Presidents after charging them with treason/corruption/insurrection only reinforces that laws are selectively applied and some are still above its law and constitution. Better would've been to refrain from the tit for tat kangaroo courts altogether to placate whatever direction the countr",

It's even questionable if data can be removed (longer discussion needed). These are compression machines, so the very act of training is compressing that information. The question really becomes how well that information is compressed or embedded into the model. On one hand, the models (typically) aren't invertible so the information is less likely to be compressed lodslessly. On the other hand, the models aren't invertible, so reversing them is probabilistic and they are harder to analyze in this sense.\n2) as you may gather from 1) there's almost certainly more issues like this. There are many unknown unknowns waiting to be discovered. Personally this is why I'm very upset the field is so product focused and that a large portion regards theory as pointless. Theory does two things for us because it builds a deeper and more nuanced understanding. Theory advancing allows us to develop faster as we can iterate on paper rather than through experimentation. This allows us to better search the solution space and even understand our understanding. This also leads to better safety of models as it is necessary to understand them to understand where they fail and how to prevent those failures. Experimentation alone is incredibly naïve.

That kind of level of micromanagement is only do-able in a command economy which is terrible for a bunch of reasons I won't go into but our tax system should work to ensure that the poorest of us have access to a baseline of benefits at the expense of the richest. Wealth and income should be taxed since income is the most direct expression of productivity and wealth is an accumulation of unspent excess.

The networking infrastructure is built in Erlang, a technology that Ericsson created in the 1980s for telecommunications. The system is spread across nine data centers around the world. The company has done tests to make sure that the latency is good.\nResmini also noted that esports competitors - or professional gamers who play games for money prizes - were worried about security. With Skype, it's easy to get somebody else's personal internet protocol (IP) address because the communication happens peer-to-peer. Citron said that Discord works through server infrastructure, so it's impossible for anyone to obtain another player's IP address.\"\nPerhaps the peers cannot obtain each others' IP addresses but the person running the Discord server has all the peers' IP addresses in addition to their payment details\nThere are few if any meaningful limits on how this data can be used, how long it can be retained or where it can be transferred.^1\nApparently this centralised architecture does not matt",

Ultimately that level of expressiveness makes the hard parts of your code more concise, more readable (as the code ends up being closer to the domain at hand), and therefore more maintainable.\nThe other thing, which it shares with Smalltalk and which I've seen pretty much nowhere else (Erlang comes very close) is the interactivity. You code inside a running system. Yes, other languages have things they call \"the REPL\", but they can't deal with classes changing shape, reloading code, etc. It makes the coding cycle much shorter, quicker feedback is better feedback, so you end up going faster (and iterating through complex stuff like that macro that will really nail how clean your top level code is will be much more doable)\nWhen I mentor coders, I often talk about malleable code, like the clay on a potter's table. As soon as you stop working it, things start solidifying and your code turns into something unchangeable and brittle.

(like >10% variability). I have theories as to why this happens, it's in firmware not OS as LineageOS shows same behavior.... but tough to really know for sure if this was by design or not.\nOh and charge thresholds only do so much, heat kills batteries reliably fast.

Mostly, it's a problem that you seem to believe that because of incremental improvements in battery technology, we're at a point where it's acceptable to make devices an end-user can't service. That we can't design for water/dust ingress protection and have an easier to replace battery.\nRealistically batteries currently made reach end of service life around 3 years, previously it was around 2. People using devices heavily (gaming/videoconferencing) or living in hot climates will have shorter service life. You can push them past the 80% health threshold, but then it's throttling, risk of bulging, etc. You got 9 or so years out of a SE using the battery long past its service life.\nBut you, (yes, you!) act like everything's currently fine with designs and that we won't burn up the batteries sooner.

On the AMD wavefront question: CDNA3's 64-lane wavefront vs NVIDIA's 32-lane warp changes the async scheduling model — you get 64-element register swaps via __shfl in one cycle (my transforms do full 8x8 matrix multiplies through wave shuffles with zero shared memory), but 64-wide means coarser divergence granularity for heterogeneous coroutine paths. An async execution model that pipelines multi-pass kernels without CPU round-trips would directly close the batch>1 gap for workloads like Winograd convolution, batched flash attention, and MoE expert dispatch. @magic_at_nodai — happy to help test AMD support when the time comes; I have working HIP kernels with wave shuffles and MFMA accumulation that would be a good real-workload stress test for the async dispatch model",

The mechanism is identical. The study isn't proving that \"files are bad,\" it's proving that \"context stuffing\" is bad. Whether I paste the rules manually or load them via a file, the transformer sees the same tokens.\n- Latent vs. Inferable Knowledge: This is the key missing variable. If I remove context files, my agents fail at tasks requiring specific process knowledge - like enforcing strict TDD or using internal wrapper APIs that aren't obvious from public docs. The agent can't \"guess\" our security protocols or architectural constraints. That's not a performance drag; it's a requirement.

Whether a chip is obtained from being specially made for that exact model of GPU, or it is obtained from being binned after possibly defective areas get fused off, you are paying for the end-result product. If that product meets the expected performance, it is doing its job. This is not a subsidy (at least, not in that direction), the die is just one small part of what makes a usable GPU card, and excess die area left dark isn't even pure waste, as it helps with heat dissipation.\nThe fact that nVidia excludes decent FP64 from all of its prosumer offerings (*) can still be called \"artificial\" insofar as it was indeed done on purpose for market segmentation purposes, but it's not some trivial trick. They really are just not putting it into the silicon. This has been the case for longer than it wasn't by now, even.\n* = The Quadro line of \"professional\" workstation cards nowadays are just consumer ",

Particularly when you consider that the model is going to spend a lot of tokens thinking and that will eat into the comparatively smaller context window.\nI switched from the Unsloth 4-bit quant of Qwen3 Coder Next to the official 4-bit quant from Qwen. Using their recommended settings I had it running with OpenCode last night and it seemed to be doing quite well. No infinite loops. Given its speed, large context window, and willingness to experiment like you mentioned I think it might actually be the best option for agentic coding on the 395+ for now.\nI am curious about https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step-3.5-Flash https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step-3.5-Flash given that it does parallel token generation.

Null denominations can exist on their own, left denominations can't -- they are inherently chained (eg arithmetic expressions, statements in a block, or elements of a tuple), and allow a succinct, infix notation for variable-length constructs (no lispy parentheses hell).\nSecond, null denominations usually introduce names -- whether for variables, types, functions, lifetimes, macros, etc. One exception to this are free-standing value expressions (a bit weird; less so when they're the last expression in a block indicating the value returned by it). Another other exception would be directive type constructs - eg directives to import names from another module, directives to give hints to the compiler, etc. The last two exceptions are the most common ones: variable assignment and function invocation.\nThe golden rule of good language design, as I see it, is this: null denominations must begin with a fixed and unique token . The only permissible exceptions should be for assignment and function invocation; exceptions which exist because those use-cases appear so often in a typical program that requiring a prefix would be insufferable.\nJulia breaks this rule for global variables.

It's comprised of two distinct things: the time it takes to compile the code, and the execution time. The issue is the compilation time: there are certain cases where it's exponential in the number of types which could unify with the callsite's type params.\n2. IIRC, Julia compiler has heuristics to ensure things don't explode for common cases. If I'm not mistaken, not only do compile times explode, but certain (very common) things don't even typecheck. There's an excellent video about it by the designer of the language, Jeff Bezanson -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuJsgyu87U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPuJsgyu87U . Note: Julia experts, please correct me if this has been fixed.\n3. The difficulty in intuiting which combinations of types will unify at a given callsite isn't theoretical; there are reports of libraries which unexpectedly fail to work together. I want to qualify this statement: Julia is light years ahead of any language lacking multimethods when it comes to library composability. But my guess is that those problems would be reduced with non-symmetric multimethods.\n4. The non-symmetric multimethod system I'm \"proposing\" isn't my idea. They are referred to variously as encapsulated or parasitic multimethods.

It's true that learning skill gives you a more nuanced view of the craft that refines your skill. But software is not only for those who have skill in it, but for everybody. Lots of amazing engineers have an awful taste (really, really awful) in everything that is not their immediate field of knowledge or interest, with the aggravation that their skill makes them arrogant.\nOn the contrary, a lower barrier for skill could bring people from other disciplines with excellent taste to make beautiful, even if technical imperfect, pieces of craft.",

Also, the ability for a government to create large amounts of money on demand allows them to spend on destructive activities which can create opportunities for certain connected people in the private sector. Price discovery in the markets cannot work if one party has a theoretically unlimited amount of currency. It just devalues the currency.\nIf the government knew that the budget was limited and they only had x amount of money to spend that year as an absolute maximum, they wouldn't be sending it to foreign countries as foreign aid.",

Old repositories have more PRs sitting around.\nWhat you really want to measure is \"how good is the product?\", or \"are we delivering quickly relative to the difficulty of what's asked?\" and those turns out to be extremely expensive to measure, so people use metrics that don't work well instead.",

No replication is perfect, but no original study is either.

Nothing was \"brought to light\" by this video, the fraud was being investigated, and Trump was aware of it. Several names I've seen thrown around were people who are already convicted. You are acting like they were disinterested in investigating fraud entirely.\nNor did this happen in a vacuum. A lot of this came from emergency economic relief, like PPP funds. Both Trump and Biden weanened PPP oversight in favor of getting funds out quickly. When you do that, there is an understanding there will be some order of fraud.\nThe completely last minute decision of Trump to make a public spectacle of something he already knew about was just a power grab to justify the ICE surge, and an opportunity to demonize the people of the state. Anyone who hasn't drunk the Koolaid would understand that. That's why the white house site does not approach the fraud in a matter of fact way. It literally calls Walz \"deranged.\"\nAnd of course, that situation spawned the trolls, where people would make videos with a deluge of \"facts\", where one instance of legitimate fraud would be combined with a bunch of bullshit evidence to make it seem like the fraud is widespread and unstoppable without Trump's intervention.

Just use https://subwaymenupedia.com/ https://subwaymenupedia.com/ , since averaging across location is really tough.\nI wish my point were uncontroversial: millions of people buy footlongs that are over 1000 calories as a regular habit. I'm critiquing folks that are incredulous about this. Subway is just an example, you can also look at Quizno's (back in the day) and Jersey Mike's (the modern equivalent). Even my local deli serves sandwiches well beyond 800 calories as their special. It's not an interesting argument to have, though. Shops wouldn't offer these meals if folks weren't buying, and I don't believe everyone's doing take-out with the second half for dinner or lunch the next day.\nEDIT: Another good source to browse: https://fastfoodnutrition.org/subway https://fastfoodnutrition.org/subway \nYou're really arguing about whether that 800 calorie run could be offset completely by a normal meal.

But then I think about my Allstate days and I can see it. I think you're being downvoted because people reading your comment haven't witnessed that sort of dysfunction in a company, but to anyone reading this- it is how some companies operate. The execs at these companies will deadass hire garbage people (usually offshore) and then brag about how much money they saved the company vs hiring U.S. citizens. Either the bill comes due years down the road when prod goes down due to a bullshit bug from the offshore team and it ends up costing the company millions, or U.S. employees are picking up the slack.\nAt Allstate (circa 2016), we were required to use offshore teams from Infosys. There was one U.S. software engineer for every 6 or so offshore \"engineers\". We weren't allowed to say \"no they actually cause more problems than they fix, you can keep paying them but we'll be paying them to do nothing\". Ha. You would have gotten fired for that level of \"insubordination\" because the higher ups legitimately didn't understand that software development is a skill - it's not like an assembly line where anyone can put an item into a box over and over again.",

I can't capture the full interview experience in a Hacker News comment but I realize the information presented isn't a dead-giveaway case of racism.\nI am well aware that it could've just been that A) their requirements for the role changed mid-interview process, B) they didn't like my personality or I came off as an asshole, C) the mid level guy didn't want me as their \"superior\" for a non-racial reason or D) Other. But I think it's dangerous to just write off any suspected racism and blame something like personality or soft-skills.

It's obviously the product of this country.\nIs your argument that since Apple makes money in other countries that they should transcend nations and become their own super-national entity? That they should not have to follow the rules or even try to benefit their home country?\nAt the end of the day that is what's happening. These mega corps have basically usurped the power of nations and made their own rules. They have changed the immigration system to give themselves the power to import cheap labor at the expense of the country that allowed them to exist in the first place.

But there is no incentive for Apple to train Americans or invest in their existing employees when they can just claim “labor shortage” and hire someone from India instead.\nWe know this works already because this is how the country worked until 1990, when they created the H1B and massively increased all other types of immigration. By 1990 the US was the undisputed powerhouse of the world, and it was built completely with native born labor.\nThere was plenty of offshoring that happened during the 90’s but the companies that rely on it heavily do not end up winning. In the end nothing beats Americans working in America and that’s obvious just by looking at the stock market.\nThe people who want to eliminate the H1B are absolutely pro-worker in my opinion. It’s a tool that’s used almost exclusively to suppress wages, the quality of the workers is almost always significantly worse than the American equivalent and serves only to boost profits for the company owners at the expense of their own workers.",

Set up GSLB at a DNS provider that does health checks or perform your own health checks to both origin and CDN's and use API's to change DNS. If the origin servers are OK and the CDN is not, automatically change DNS to a different CDN. There should be multiple probes that form a consensus. This process assumes one is managing the configurations of their CDN's through code and API so that one can set up and tear down any number of CDN's on a whim.\nThat does mean having contracts with more than one CDN provider however the cost should be negotiated based on monthly volume. i.e. the CDN with the most uptime gets the most money. If an existing CDN under contract refuses to negotiate then move some non critical path services to them and let that contract expire.

Non developers will be able to create some stuff.\nWhat this means is that very simple apps will become easy to create quickly. So a todo manager is probably not going to be a very successful business. You’ll be competing with many many people and it will be commoditised.\nBut ultimately what happens here is the “complexity threshold” of a sufficiently complex product needed to make money will be raised. Existing products will become more sophisticated or, if there is not more “sophistication ladder to climb” then they will be commoditised.\nThere’s just no way people are going to vibe all their software, that’s a very self absorbed nerd take. But on the supply side we’ll see commoditisation, price drops, and increasingly good value for the user as features are shipped faster.\nI also think that software quality is really going to tank, because using validation to test the output of Claude is not a good way to ensure quality or correctness. It’ll get you some of the way but you need powerful reasoning. The most obvious evidence for this is security flaws in AI code. We’ll see a new era of enshitification caused by AI code. Like outsourced manufacturing though, people will buy worse stuff at a cheaper price. That makes me sad, because I thought we were on a path to better software, not buggier software.",

I've been reviewing AI-generated PRs for a while now and the scariest stuff isn't malicious packages or shell escapes, it's subtle auth logic that almost works correctly. a sandbox won't catch that your token validation silently accepts expired tokens because the LLM generated a comparison that looks right but isn't. tbh I think containerization is necessary but it's solving maybe 30% of the problem. the other 70% is what happens to the code after it leaves the sandbox and enters your actual codebase. that part nobody really has good tooling for yet",

Size is a design-time consideration; caring about it in the code is an exceptional case, for applications like (as you mention) serialization. So that's what deserves the dedicated term. \"Length\" refers specifically to a total number of elements in many languages preceding Rust.\nFor that matter, many languages, especially \"object-oriented\" ones, treat heterogeneous containers as the default. They might not even offer native containers that can store everything inline in a single contiguous allocation, except perhaps for strings. In which case, \"number of bytes\" is itself ambiguous; are you including the indirected objects or not?\n\"Count\" is also overloaded — it commonly means, and I normally only understand it to mean, the number of elements in a collection meeting some condition . Hence the `.count` method of Python sequences, as well as the jargon \"population count\" referring to the number of set bits in an integer. Today, Python's integers have both a `.bit_count` and a `.bit_length`, and it's obvious what both of them do; calling either `.bit_size` would be confusing in my mental framework, and a contradiction in terms in the OP's.\nI would disagree that even C's `strlen` refers to byte size. C comes from a pre-Unicode world; the type is called `char` because that was naively considered sufficient at the time to represe",

Everyone just grabs and re-uploads the existing images from the image search results if they are “similar enough”. Because if it works for instant noodles, it works for books, too. Many publishers don't even bother to provide anything but a single image that is cut from the source file for the printed cover, which might be quite different from the way the book really looks.\nFor my language, I know I can only rely on just a couple of shops that make a photo of an actual book under regular lights for catalogues and announcements as a matter of principle. Others just add the same image file everyone else used. For the older books that had multiple revisions, it's still strictly manual interaction with second-hand book sites and old listings to figure out the exact version.\nOn the other hand, most services here do care about providing table of contents, even if its crowd-sourced phone snapshots of the page. International market is insane in that regard. Not only sellers on Amazon and the like ignore them (sure, they were never going to do so much manual work for all the uploaded items anyway), the publishers don't even mention what's inside on their official pages. “Selected stories. New translation by X”. Are those the same stories that were published 5 or 10 years ago under a different name or cover? Has X translated a new s",

At least with LibraryThing it always seems like somebody has cataloged everything, but we have such a hodgepodge of ID systems and catalog numbers in part because so rarely have all the catalogs been connected or have tried to be connected. It's only a relatively recent library phenomenon that so many small library catalogs can talk to each other on the same protocol, much less coexist in the same broader search tool.\n> Cataloging my own library, I've had to use a hodgepodge of unique ids. ASINs, ISBNs, Worldcat's OCLC numbers, Open Library's, and a few others besides.\nIn part because most of my personal catalog is in LibraryThing, I've been impressed with LibraryThing's Works ID as a generally trustworthy unique ID for a book. LibraryThing benefits from an interesting mix of volunteer and professional librarian work (especially the work of a lot of tiny and interesting niche libraries across the world) in deduping and merging editions together into the same Work ID.

It was very difficult for me to understand the points from Cosmo's article, even if it seems more technically correct and less notes-y. Actually, it was likely because it was aiming for high technical correctness that some sentences are impossible for me to digest. ( AlphaZero is a strange inversion of RL, where all of the “learning how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward signal” is done online, by a GOFAI algorithm, and absolutely no reinforcement learning makes it into the actual gradient used to train the network! )\nI think you may have misunderstood the Now we get to the scathing criticism line as being literal rather than ironic (or literal disguised as irony), because most of Cosmo's points are clarifications and distinctions only understandable or valuable to chess engine/ML experts. Many of Cosmo's points are agreement or unrelated; many others are self-professed nitpicks; and among the rest, I think Cosmo is being overly harsh.

I think also people understand that the VDOM is a lightweight, quick-to-generate version of the DOM, and then assume that the VDOM therefore makes things fast, but forget about (or don't understand) the patching part of React, which is also necessary if you've got a VDOM and which is slow.",

Receiving any dose is usually a cause for concern at most facilities that handle radioactive materials. A full body x-ray would dose you with about 1000 mrem. For about every 10000 mrem you receive, you gain an additional 1% chance of lifetime cancer risk. There's a reason why you wear a lead apron when getting X-rays at the doctor's office and why the technician leaves the room.\nMetal detectors would be a much more reasonable method. People that work at airports, courts, jails, some schools, and even some manufacturing facilities walk through metal detectors daily.",

And then on another layer the books are about her thoughts on parenting, marriage, power, inheritance, and so on.\nGood art isn't about accepting someone's opinion that it's good art.

Same thing with singing more or less (although it's harder to sing well than write at all well).\nI think I realised that while reading Harry Potter. To be fair the writing in the books is abysmally bad. It's written by an adult woman but it comes across as the writing of a 14 year old child, and that's to be charitable.\nAnd it doesn't matter one bit. It still became the best-selling book in history with 600 million copies sold worldwide (as Wikipedia tells me). That's not to say that there aren't many hundreds, possibly even thousands of better written series, even in the Young Adult space. There are. But they're not that successful.\nWhy? I guess because good writing doesn't matter so much as what's being written. And I guess that also doesn't matter that much. You just have to connect somehow, be in the right place at the right time, when the need to read a certain piece of writing sort of emerges naturally as a result of whatever forces shape ambient taste.\nWho knows. But most people wouldn't know what good writing looks like anymore than they could write well themselves, so it's obvious that the ability to write well is over-rated.\nAnd so now we have LLMs generating prose and that's what we'll be reading henceforth. I think it will be gradual, but it's unavoidable. One day nobody will read anything anyone else has written anymore. Why",

These stories of incredibly facility of LLMs on code and writing are never accompanied by artifacts that back up these claims. The ones that I can assess don't meet the bar that is being claimed.

I can't rule it out entirely of course, but I am frustrated at the ongoing demands that I maintain credulity.\nFWIW I have sat out many other professional organization and software development trends because I wanted to wait and assess for myself their benefits, which then failed to materialize.

It's also extremely fragile: one line code change or a small refactor or optimization can completely invalidate hundreds of proofs.

If you adjust the steering and suspension in a car correctly, it'll drive in a perfectly straight line with no user input for a surprisingly long way. With modern electronic power steering and throttle-by-wire systems it's actually surprisingly easy to turn an off-the-shelf car (even something cheap, secondhand, and quite old like a 2010s Vauxhall Corsa) into a simple line-following robot like we used to build at uni in the 80s and 90s in robotics class.

I am rather fond of reading historical diaries as part of a general curiosity about the past, and reading the experiences as they were written is as interesting to me if not more so than the aggregate information, personally.\n[1] Although, of course, there is the question of reliability. For example, the \"Boy Scouts\" page says Boy Scouts have 2 mentions, but has references to 3 diary entries! Also, on further examination, Sep 1931 has broken dates (meaning my previous theory about it breaking only after Jul 1941 was wrong), and some pages appear to be out of order.",

But, it takes away from the view-ability of the site, which is not good.\nLLM's ability to take 7400+ handwritten entries and try to make a narrative out them is amazing. With all of the AI experiments on HN lately, we're figuring out the power of LLMs, but it most cases, it still needs a human refining touch, and we need to remember that.

New techniques to discuss? I don't know, and I'd love to talk about it.\nConcerning OCR: I used Mistral because of a posting here describing advancements with handwriting recognition a month or so ago.

This was a physically smaller subspecies that was later extirpated by the Romans. Perhaps analysis of the bone in this story will help settle the debate.\nIt's also worth noting that, despite the insane effort it must have taken to get elephants over the alps, all but one of Hannibal's elephants died during the first winter in Italy. They made for a great story and were a propaganda coup for the Carthaginians, but didn't wind up making much of a military impact. They were only present for the first couple of battles Hannibal fought.\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_elephant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_elephant",

My kids watch plenty of Tv and I’m not going to rave about it, it’s crappy kid TV, we try to push some educational stuff too.

Preloading would be simul-loading and lag the hell out of your main window.\nThe way to instruct a browser to load back then was to wait for the user to actually click to fetch, and that would navigate away from the current page.",

The flip side is non-negotiable: compilers can't «guess» facts they can't prove, and many of the most valuable optimisations require guarantees about aliasing, alignment, loop independence, value ranges, and absence of UB that are often not derivable from arbitrary pointer-heavy C, especially under separate compilation.\nThat is why constructs such as «restrict», attributes and pragmas exist: they are not insanity, they are explicit ",

My overall point is that you are silently making the argument that C programmers (or programmers in general) used to be better, which is a wild argument to be making about a culture in which fuzzing didn’t even exist as a concept. You’re also confusing memory safety with implying a crash. That simply isn’t the case - it’s more often exploitable as a security vulnerability than an immediate crash by violating assumptions made that weren’t in the happy path of those microwaves and security systems. That millions of devices were and still are routinely exploitable.\nYou’re also making a fallacious line of reasoning that the C today is the same C that was in use in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It’s not and has gotten harder and more dangerous because a) multi threading became more of a thing and b) compiler authors started exploiting “undefined” behaviors for extra optimization.\nIt’s just wild for me to encounter someone who believes C is a safe language and is suitable to connect to I/",

(After all, I was talking about him in the context of 'Buddhist empires'). Nor did I claim that he didn't espouse Buddhist values. What I was pointing out was that he expanded his empire through ruthless warfare, and later used his political acumen to reform his image as a \"monk-king\", as he focused on strengthening Buddhism as the \"official\" religion of his empire. (Buddhist missionaries of course played a huge role in this as it was in their interest to exaggerate and showcase how their religion had transformed a \"blood-thirsty\" king to a saint!). And, by the way, if you don't consider the rock edicts as a form of propaganda (without the negative connotation), you clearly don't understand politics. The point was that however much a practising Buddhist he became in his later parts of years, he (or his descendants) never confused the Buddhist spiritual philosophy of \"Ahimsa\" with the politics of why an empire needs a military.

For some reason, tech recruiters seem to believe that everyone outside of tech has been ignoring the massive layouts and still think that tech is super sexy and are just dying to work for tech no matter how low the salary is.\nI am also fortunate enough to live in a state where job postings are required by law to include a salary range of actual or target salaries for the position (meaning, it must include both the salary range the company is willing to pay and also capture the salaries of anyone at the company who has substantially the same title or job responsibilities).

It's a balancing act to find strength and feeling capable through sport without increasing insomnia and early waking, likely because of cortisol spikes.\nSport does more for me than antidepressants, which have little effect than making me feel tired all the time. I've gone through a whole battery of them with little success and I've become quite critical of them.

And every company has their battle scars from that time. Final fantasy development exploded in budget, the \"Tales of\" series coasted along (fans would call it the \"call of duty of JRPGs\"), Atlus had to be bought out by Sega to survive (and fortunately, thrive), Monolith broke off of Bandai Namco and went to Nintendo, and so many more stories.

Russian objective is and was not to annex entire Ukraine, but to ensure that it does not become menacing part of NATO infrastructure (they are surprisingly content with Ukraine joining EU). This is political goal and thus can be pursued through hybrid warfare, which includes psychological pressure on Ukrainian population, to ensure that current administration will loose political support and will be pressured into a peace deal on terms favorable for Russia. Ukraine does the same to achieve the opposite goal, but of course with much less success.\nThe whole story with territorial question is part of this: possible peace settlement could include just splitting Donbas region on the current front line, so that Putin could claim victory and Ukraine could just say they did what they could. But Russia wants more, they need Donbas in original borders, which is unacceptable to Ukraine. Why? Because if this question will be settled in the peace deal, it may open Ukraine eventually path to NATO. They want to create permanent tension the same way as it happened to Georgia, deferring the final settlement by a hundred years (see Taiwan as an example, which occupies China for decades).",

Meanwhile, Spain could barely cross the Pacific ocean and make it the viable trade route to the spice islands that it longed for to be.\nMany forget that the circumnavigation of Magellan was both a mistake and a failure. The discovered pass to the Pacific, the southernmost point in the planet not counting Antarctica, was considered unnavigable most of the year (the magellan fleet had to wait 6 months at Puerto San Julian before daring to continue the search, surviving its first mutiny attempt), before treading the slow currents of the Pacific, which took down the majority of the fleet to scurvy (while most likely contributing to the madness of Magellan, which made him the delirious zealot which jumped foolishly to his death at the hands of Lapu Lapu). In fact, part of the fleet tried to make it back through the Pacific, only to give up again, come back to the spice islands and be captured by the portuguese, while the remainder barely made it back, commanded by Elcano, one of the mutineers of Puerto San Julian; a route that btw, they feared taking, as it was in direct violation of the Tordesillas treaty and would certainly condemn them to death would they be discovered. 1 ship out of 5 made it back. 18 ",

The Nazis placed people into labor camps because of their ethnicity and later murdered them.\nFurthermore many legally immigrant groups and ethnic minorities in America such as the Latinos in South Texas and South Florida voted for Trump specifically so he could pursue these immigration policies.\nI agree these policies have gone too far though.

It’s corrosive to have different classes of people with different labor protection rules, wages, etc. There simply is not a clean path forward that doesn’t involve some kind of amnesty simply because seeking justice would be a humanitarian and economic crisis.\nAmnesty might not be justice, but as a nation it’s our penance for decades of destabilizing our neighbors and allowing this situation to continue.

The first surprise was that most Verilog/RTL guys didn't know anything about software (not even assembly/C!) while of course embedded software guys (like myself) didn't know anything about HDLs. There was (and is) a very hard disconnect which is quite interesting. In the spirit of the OP article, the book i linked to actually shows a path via Vivado HLS for software folks to move into hardware design using their C/C++ programming skills. But i would like to see some hardware designer here validate that approach in the real-world. Especially now that you have powerful AI tools available to help you do stuff faster and easier.\nWith the rise of demanding AI/ML/Crypto applications, there is now a greater interest in designing new types of custom hardware requiring Hardware/Software Modeling(verification/benchmarking)/Co-Design/Co-Verification etc. They involve designing complete SoCs containing CPU/GPU/FPGAs based on specific designs. Given that hardware design is a universe of its own, not knowing the overall picture i.e. architecture/tools/methodologies/etc. makes it quite daunting for software folks to approach it.\nPS: Maybe you can augment/create-new blog post with an actual case ",

Consider this example:\n [fn consume [xs]\n [println [str \"got \" [len xs] \" items\"]]]\n [let items #[1 2 3]]\n [consume items]\n ; items has been moved — using it here is a compile error\n \nThis is described as an example of a setting where the variable 'items' has been moved, so it can no longer be used. However, the consume function does not mutate its argument, so I don't see why 'items' can no longer be used. In addition, it seems to me that the term 'moved' is being used to mean 'mutated'. Is that correct, or do I have it wrong?\nAnother example from the website is the following:\n [fn length [xs] [len xs]]\n\n [let items #[1 2 3]]\n [println [length items]]\n [println [length items]] ; items not consumed\n \nThe website explains this example as follows: \"If the compiler can prove that a reference will not outlive the owner, it passes a borrow instead of moving.\" However, there are no references in this example, only the original variable 'items'.

He actually went and talked to the musicians, actors, and writers of the era to have a better understanding of the culture and view points that the people still held after the war. I will take his expertise over those of the modern era that have not engaged with these people that lived through it.\nPeople scoff at the idea _Jews for Hitler_. Reality is that a number of Jewish Germany actually supported Hitler and Fascism in the 1920-1930s and latter. It latches onto the idea that that modern day people would be able to pick out Fascism and reject it ... which has shown to be the opposite with populism.\nBy the way, I consumed _Mein Kampf_ by Adolf Hilter. It was not to align with his ideology but to understand it and have an independent reference to _like Hilter_ that politicians, the media, and pop culture use, and as a base understand of Fascism. I in fact reject Fascism, Nazism, and Adolf Hitler.\nExample is that Hilter's take over of Europe was under the disguise that resources are ours for the taking and are needed to support the country. He states this in his book. This is the same statement that Donald Trump and his executive branch uses against Greenland. Yet history proved Hilter wrong. Technology is what drives the economy not direct resource access. Japan, USA, South Korea proved this after WWII.\n[0] https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/c",

And for all the thinking you've done, the best you can come up with is \"nyuh uh, something will magically make it all change just before it'd get REAL bad\".\n>At worst, we'll end up in a world where the majority of the population consists of the descendants of current high-fertility subcultures.\nThese aren't little dots of mold in a petri dish. The high-fertility subcultures don't survive this any more than anyone else does. The Duggars don't get to have 400 grandchildren, even if they had 20 children. The Amish don't get to stay the Amish... too dependent on their host culture. Sure, they can build a barn in a day but there's not a single fucking Amish nail factory (or iron foundry, or ore mines) anywhere. They don't weave their own cloth. They're doomed too.\n>Fertility rates only become a population-level problem a few generations down the line, at which point we are almost guaranteed to have artificial wombs\nScience fiction magic will save us!

When your mind is in state of fear/anxiety it impedes your ability to think clearly (or so I believe several studies have indicated). Likely by design? Tried reading various left/right media in multiple countries to get a better picture, but it is very homogeneous. Really, instead of looking at spin, better to see which stories are ignored - especially on “both” sides.

There is no plausible mechanism by which low fertility rates could lead to extinction,\nMost people who think they are clever say this. I don't even doubt that you are, it's that you're lazy and never bothered to think about it. Yes, sub-replacement fertility inevitably leads to extinction and especially so for a species like humanity (given the root causes). If each generation is inevitably smaller than the last, then at some point the only smaller number is zero. And if the rate of fertility decline continues to accelerate, it isn't thousands of years in the future either. Since each youngest generation is raised by the older generations who had low fertility themselves, that youngest generation internalizes it at norm... so population can't plateau and drop no more (which would require the women in that youngest generation to grow up and all decide to have 2.1 children on average).\n>Come on, just think about this for a minute. Is your model that we're just going to have fewer children,\nIn my model, each generation adopts the anthropological norms of western civilization which includes low fertility, but inevitably sets it as their ceiling . They can have fewer than that norm for any reason (bad luck, economic woes, whatever), but they'll never have more. And if they *do* have fewer, they've just set the norm even lower for the subsequent generation. This and dozens of oth",

But generally, I'd say if it lives longer than a day, that's getting too old. (Exceptions apply.)\nCode should live in main/master and be in a production environment as soon as possible, but it does not have to run for all, most or even any customers/clients from the start. You can gate it behind feature switches, preprocessor directives, global constants, whatever. As long as it has an active purpose and is being developed further, it is not dead. Ideally, it will have tests.\nThe result of merging back to main often is that other changes will be made in awareness of your new code, and all merging will happen organically and in small increments. You also get to develop complex features bit by bit, in a way that can be verified in a real environment in a controlled way. And everything can be deployed anytime, which should happen often.\nBeing able to verify incrementally and get quick feedback lowers the risk of otherwise releasing a hitherto completely untested large feature into the wild in one go.\nThis does not absolve you from making sure that your changes actually work as intended. That will be easier if you portion the work into smaller chunks that are easier to understand than a whole, complex, all-o",

Subsidizing less (like $3k not $7k) on a whole bunch more hybrids would have done a lot more to influence real adoption and rack up fuel efficient miles than purely electric cars. A lot of people don't get hybrids cause they are like ~$8k ish more than basic gas and the math doesn't quite work out for people for a long time, tilting that math would have made a big difference.\nEspecially for people who live in the city but sometimes drive long distance and only have one car, a PHEV is so ideal compared to having to have two cars or go rent or something.",

AI will generate absolutely useless tests, and since it seems even the latest version have difficulties to generate working test doubles (which i'm _still_ surprised about, but i took 4 hour generating a dogshit test double i could have written in half the time. To me this should be a something AI should be absolutely great at, and it's not), if your test are AI-only, understanding of the underlying system will be hard.\nOn bugfixing I agree with your message, but disagree on the scope: bugfixing changed for some categories of bugs (most of them tbh), but some will still have you dig deep into the database or the transaction history/monitoring.\nOn enhancement i agree 100%, i think this is the biggest benefit of AI. Even new hires can land a few enhancement a week without any domain knowledge. Our backlog is almost empth, and only the largest enhancement are up (basically performance improvement)\nSorry i wanted to nitpick, I do that very often when i think i mostly agree with someone except on very specific points.",

Bugs are always going to be shipped into production, no matter who or what is writing the code. Where SDLC is really getting compressed is in the iteration phase.\nFor example:\n- \"This is a known good state; write tests to enforce this state\" is something that takes minutes now instead of days. That is incredibly powerful for understanding and maintaining a system.\n- Bugfixing is a matter now of an agent watching error logs, diagnosing traces, and immediately issuing PRs with suggested fixes, something that again would have taken hours at least and is now down to minutes (and can be a 24x7 operation, which for most businesses is a revelation).\n- Engineers have the freedom to land enhancements that in the Before Times would have sat in the backlog for months and years on end because of the time commitment. That has knock-on effects of quality, features, and just overall improvements for users.\nIt is a very, very, very different world that we're operating in, and what used to be huge steps of the SDLC now take less time than checking your email in the mornings with your first cup of coffee.",

I've been dancing - it's a usual thing all humans naturally do when they hear rhythm that resonates with them unless they consciously resist dancing for one reason or another. though, this time, no one joined me. people just made space around me and pointed their cameras at me, which created a ton of unease and I eventually stopped. it was enough to get viral in local Telegrams, but I had no joy in that. in the moment, I wanted to shout, \"duh, why aren't you all dancing? put down your goddamn cameras, you can always scroll later!\"\nphones, primarily due to their current addictive implementation, are such a killjoy.

Of course, the is not much physical space, which is how the dance-movements evolved as they have (e.g you never spin and you feet never really leave the space they are on). But this is part of the culture, and not a problem. If you can't find it then that's your problem, but doesn't mean that other's can not freely express themselves there.\nThere's more dance-events. Not sure where you are, but you can usually go to a bachata night as it's quite trendy now, northern soul is also getting some revivial.

Most likely without having ever to rise to today's actual percentages.\nIf tariffs had been done correctly and gradually, there would have been no pain progressing all the way to zero income tax on average Americans a bit earlier in the 21st century than now, and it would have been worth waiting for. Especially as soon as the budget got balanced it was very stupid not to take this kind of action which could make it consistently be a bigger surplus every year after that.\nAnd ",

Consistency is tough at this volume. I’m sharing the solution we found, which has become our main product.\nContinue ( https://docs.continue.dev https://docs.continue.dev ) runs AI checks on every PR. Each check is a source-controlled markdown file in `.continue/checks/` that shows up as a GitHub status check. They run as full agents, not just reading the diff, but able to read/write files, run bash commands, and use a browser. If it finds something, the check fails with one click to accept a diff. Otherwise, it passes silently.\nHere’s one of ours:\n .continue/checks/metrics-integrity.md\n\n ---\n name: Metrics Integrity\n description: Detects changes that could inflate, deflate, or corrupt metrics (session counts, event accuracy, etc.)\n ---\n\n Review this PR for changes that could unintentionally distort metrics.\n These bugs are insidious because they corrupt dashboards without triggering errors or test failures.\n\n Check for:\n - \"Find or create\" patterns where the \"find\" is too narrow, causing entity duplication (e.g. querying only active sessions, missing completed ones, so every new commit creates a duplicate)\n - Event tracking calls inside loops or retry paths that fire multiple times per logical action\n - Refactors that accidentally remove or move tracking calls to a path that executes with different frequency\n\n Key files: anything containing `posthog.capture` or `trackEvent`\n\n \nThis check passed without noise for weeks, but then caught a PR that would have silently deflated our session counts. We added it in the first place because we’d been burned in the past by bad data, only noticing when a dashboard looked off.\n---\nTo get started, paste this into Claude Code or your coding agent of choice:\n Help me write checks for this codebase: https://continue.dev/walkthrough\n \nIt will:\n- Explore the codebase and use the `gh` CLI to read past review comments\n- Write checks to `.continue/checks/`\n- Optionally, show you how to run them locally or in CI\nWould love your feedback!",

SQL is ubiquitous. It’s the closest to a lingua franca that we have in the context of software engineering. And I’m going to be blunt here and say that purposefully avoid learning and understanding SQL if it is part of the job, should disqualify anyone from it.\nI’ve been around for some decades too, and to me, ORMs haven’t worked out. They are vastly different one from another and they often create issues that are clear as day when the query is written as SQL. If I go from a Typescript codebase to Python to Java, then, according to you, I should learn the intricacies of Sequelize, SQLAlchemy, and JPA/Hibernate, instead of just SQL. And granted, different SQL dialects have different quirks, but more often than not, the pitfalls are more apparent than when switching between ORMs.\nAnd I can guarantee that someone equipped with a good foundation in SQL will be more successful debugging a Sequelize based application, than someone who has relied on SQLAlchemy.\nWhat most people I know and worked with need, is types. Types help glue SQL and any other language together. If I can run any SQL query and the result comes back as an object, I’m good.\nNow, if your point is that ORMs are OK for toying around, I may agree, but still, why would I go through that ",

Another major time saving benefit is not having to manually map a SQL result to objects.\nBut an often super underrated and incredibly valuable benefit, especially on substantial sized code bases, is the type safety aspect. The queries written using LINQ are checked for free at compile time against mistakes in column or table names.\nWant to refactor your schema because your business domain has shifted or you just understand it better than before? No problem. Use standard refactoring tools on your C# code base, have EF Core generate the migration and you’re done in 10s of minutes, including fixing all your “SQL queries” (which were in LINQ).\nEF Core is almost always a no brainer for any team who wants high quality and velocity.",

They help to reduce the boilerplate and improve the code maintainability.\nWe have a complex project with a custom back-end framework that also includes a custom ORM. The ORM covers about 95% of the use cases just fine. It reduces a lot of boilerplate and also makes it possible to find the logic much easier (for example, setting and reading some column from a specific table). Although I have to say, it works that well also thanks to good integration with the framework (fronted, included) and advanced features, like calculated fields with automatic recalculation triggering, integration with user permissions, ability to define custom user permission validation logic before / after saving rows, etc. If we really need an unusual operation where the ORM doesn't suffice (most of the time complicated search queries or some aggregation), we can write raw SQL and, if possible, encapsulate it at repository / service level. But 95% of use cases are covered by the ORM (including the management of parent / child relationships).\nI think some \"old school\" folks like to bash ORMs and view them as very limited and inefficient compared to raw SQL. But you can use them both: primarily ORM and in specific cases switching to raw SQL when ORM doesn't suffice.",

(And also some of the JSON object store databases before switching to Postgres for that stuff.) The only ones I’ve used ORMs with are Postgres and MySQL.\nSQLC does not address most of the perceived advantages to ORMs. Sure it addresses some of the concerns of hand-writing and sending SQL to databases from various languages, but that’s not what most people I’ve spoken to in the past couple of decades most valued about ORMs. What most projects really need databases for is some place to essentially store context-sensitive variable values. Like what email address to send something to if the user ID is 12345. I’ve never, ever had to debug ORM’s SQL when doing things like that. Rarely have I needed to with more complex chains of filters or whatnot, and that usually involved taking a slightly different approach with the given ORM tools rather than modifying them or writing my own SQL. When I’ve had more complex needs that required using some of the more exotic Postgres features, writing my own queries has been trivial. It’s of paramount importance for developers to understand the frameworks and libraries, such as ORMs, they’re using because those implementation details touch everything in your code.

The truth is that they work, but by saving bits of time and mental energy here and there. Those savings are meaningful in the aggregate and compound over time.\nBut there are a few catches.\nFirst, most of the savings is realized by integrating the tools into workflows that are personal and often sui generis . That takes, on the one hand, know-how (but firms deployed the tools without clear direction and without training workers); and, on the other hand, time and effort (but many of the largely untrained workers aren't investing time and effort to do so, even if they have the know-how).\nSecond, even where the training, time, and effort hurdles are cleared, the benefits inure primarily to the workers themselves: less time and mental energy spent doing what appear to be coordination tasks — ones that, so far, have been considered necessary but do not meaningfully represent the firm's actual value creation. For the benefits to inure to the firm (and thus appear on the radar of CEOs like those interviewed for the Fortune survey tangentially mentioned in TFA) the workers would need to \"reinvest\" the time and mental-energy savings in activities directly causing the value the firm is presumed to produce. They have little incentive to do so and they do not. Hence no increased firm productivity.\nAnd third, even where the \"reinvest your new-found ease to benefit the firm\"",

As these tools become common, separating low-effort output from thoughtful analysis is going to matter more, not less.\nIronically, this ties back to the original question about bubbles. If AI-generated content becomes abundant and cheap, signal will only survive where there’s clear economic or technical grounding behind it.\nI’m spending a lot of time thinking about that boundary right now, especially in developer-facing systems where quality and constraint adherence actually matter. The difference between fluff and production-grade behavior is becoming very measurable.\nCurious how others here distinguish between shallow AI-assisted output and work that’s actually grounded in systems thinking.",

I just get concerned about the concentration of value (for example, 30ish percent of the S&P 500s value is tied to 7 companies) and the shear size of the capex going on (conservatively, hundreds of billions). This increases the risk significantly. Even a normal correction (20% decline) of the stock prices of those 7, will wipe out trillions of dollars in market value and hit everyone, because everyone is essentially invested in it already and the repercussions of that could be brutal (deep recession).\nAdditionally, new tech could make all the CAPEX in data centers or businesses useless in the fairly near future, but this can be hard to predict (black swan). I think of quantum computers or advancements like DeepSeek's LLM reinforcement learning style, but it will likely be something that isn't in anyone's mind yet.

The fact that most such sightings are misinterpretations of natural phenomena would be swept away by the sheer number of events, i.e. by replication, not interpretation.\n> And also, science is in a crisis due to the lack (or really large delay) of practical use.\nThat's not a crisis in science, because science doesn't care whether an idea can be applied, only whether it can be verified, whether it resists falsification.\nWhen Maxwell constructed his electromagnetic theory, it had no practical application -- none whatever. But much of modern technology relies to a greater or lesser degree on Maxwell's work, 175 years later. Because of Maxwell's theory with no practical application, Einstein regarded him as a scientist on a par with Newton.\nRichard Feynman correctly called science \"The pleasure of finding things out,\" with no consideration given to science's applications, if any. Science is judged, not based on its utility, but on its accuracy.\nScience asks, \"Is this true?\" It doesn't ask, \"How can we sell this?\" That's not science, that's marketing.",

The idea is to use it in a long list of other organic alcohols and try to find a better compound.\nBut they choose chemical reactions that are usual in the lab, so they guess they will be able to make it work in the lab, and they keep most of the structure without changes.

I do the learning, memorizing, and reviewing of the sentences in Mochi using FSRS. I practice writing and pronunciation as I go along with the cards.

I return to Glossika and occasionally cram pronunciation practice from the human-generated audio there (Mochi is TTS, after all).\n5. I supplement with TV and radio for immersion.

Emulation of some intuitive perception of \"this is something computeresque and it's broken or acting how it shouldn't\" has tons of applications in media, particularly in commercial creative workflows where actually getting down and dirty with file formats or hardware is either cost or application prohibitive, but will often draw strong criticism from glitch artists. There is a philosophical parallel between this \"hard glitch\" versus \"glitch aesthetic\" constrast to criticisms of AI generated images and manmade art, largely centered around the ethos of the work. There's also the undeniable differences in the compositions of hard glitches and new aesthetic media - most hard glitches are ugly, as they're not generally designed to be visually appealing or communicative in the way that new aesthetic deliberately is. The deliberate composition and curation (or complete lack thereof) of hard glitch elements that makes up much glitch art is arguably just as important to its ethos as the hard glitches themselves, IMO.\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Aesthetic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Aesthetic",

They're connected through Tenet (the scheduler), not through a direct pipe.\nYes, the LLM is swappable. Alexitha is currently a fine-tuned 7B model, but the interface is not model specific. Any model that can read a cgroup event stream and output a scheduling decision can be slot in. I'm planning to test with smaller models (1-3B) to reduce boot overhead.",

      "body_text": "Hey HN,\nI've been building Aether, a background agent that takes production errors from Sentry and attempts to turn them into verified pull requests.\nWhen a new error hits your Sentry project:\n1. Sentry webhook fires with the stack trace, breadcrumbs, and context\n2. Aether spins up an isolated Fly.io VM and clones the repo at the relevant commit\n3. Agent analyzes the stack trace, reproduces the issue, proposes a fix\n4. Starts the dev server, re-runs tests, and can verify the running app with Playwright (headless Chromium is pre-installed in every VM)\n5. A review pass evaluates the diff before a PR is opened\n6. Pushes to a feature branch and opens a GitHub PR, but only if verification succeeds\n7. If CI fails, it retries once with the failure logs. If it fails again, the task is marked failed. No infinite loops.\nWhy full VMs instead of worktrees? Each task runs in its own isolated machine with a real filesystem, real process model, real network stack. It can `npm install`, run a dev server on port 3000, and Playwright can hit `localhost:3000` because it's an actual environment, not a sandbox. Since each task is its own VM, preview URLs are exposed per task via a gateway proxy so you can inspect the running app while the agent works. VMs shut down shortly after the task completes.\nThere's a simple multi-agent setup: a solver proposes the fix, a review agent evaluates the diff, and the fix has to survive re-execution in a clean isolated environment before a PR gets opened. Not claiming formal guarantees here, just requiring the fix to actually execute successfully in a reproducible environment before it touches your repo.\nLimitations:\n- Works best on well-tested codebases where \"reproduce and verify\" is meaningful\n- If reproduction isn't deterministic, results degrade\n- CI retry is capped at one automatic attempt\n- Code review is model-driven, not an architectural enforcement layer\n- BYOK only, you bring your own API key via OpenRouter. No markup on model costs but it's not super cheap to run\n- Sentry integration is built but waiting on approval from Sentry, coming soon\n- CLI is also coming soon\nBug fixing is the main focus but it's built on top of a general-purpose background agents system that works today. The agent is still great at general coding tasks. You can give the agent tasks from a full web IDE with a code editor, terminal, file tree, and agent chat panel. CLI is coming soon too (`aether run \"add auth to the API\"`). Each task gets its own isolated VM with shareable preview URLs so you can hand someone a link to see exactly what the agent built. Similar to Cursor background agents but running in the cloud with full environment isolation instead of local worktrees.\nStack: Go API (Chi), Fly.io VMs, React 19 + Vite frontend, Bun workspace service inside each VM, Supabase for auth/db/realtime, Playwright + Chromium preinstalled on each VM.\nSelf-serve right now: GitHub OAuth, connect a repo, and go via the web IDE. Sentry and CLI coming soon.\nWo",

CrossRef and Semantic Scholar APIs for DOI matching, citation counts, abstracts\n 5. 87 of 207 papers got DOI matches; the rest are identified but not in major indexes\n\n Stack: FastAPI + SQLite (FTS5 for full-text search) + Cloudflare R2 for PDFs + nginx/Docker on Hetzner.\n\n The fields represented are genuinely iteresting: there's a cluster of child abuse/grooming research, but also quantum gravity, AGI safety, econophysics, and regenerative medicine. Each paper links back to its original government PDF and Bates number.\n \nFor sure not an exhaustive list. Would be happy to add more if anyone finds them.",

We were presented a unique challenge of testing a system where the only interface was voice based, and as much as I like talking on the phone , we decided to create a test harness to facilitate the actual testing in a more systematic way. The technical test harness was the easy part, though. Creating test goals and attack strategies to help facilitate repeated and comprehensive testing became the real challenge. As such, we have been working on documenting our processes to share with the greater community and as a starting point for discussion. These systems present unique challenges where cleverness appears to be the name of the game. Such as suggesting for the agent to share its thoughts in “Inner Monologue” tags instead of “thinking” tags because those were specifically excluded in the agents prompt. Ya know, just silly things. Anyway, if reading is not your thing, I also did a walkthrough video of this methodology here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmqCXsEc8Y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNmqCXsEc8Y \ntl;dr: AI testing is tricky, we are documenting and sharing our tricks\nDo you have any favorite AI jailbreak tricks?",

      "body_text": "hey HN, happy Monday!\nI got sick of receiving personal messages that were clearly written by AI, so I vibe-coded a pastebin-like service that allows authors to electively prove they wrote something themselves.\nhow it works:\n- typing rhythm analysis: analyzing your keystroke patterns to measure how human-like they are, based on rhythm, speed, variance, etc.\n- audio verification: optionally, corroborating the audio from your microphone with your keystrokes as you type, to get an \"audio verification\" badge.\nin an increasingly AI-generated world, I think it's very important for us humans to be able to prove to each other that we actually wrote a piece of text ourselves. this is especially true for personal messaging and social media IMHO.\nso perhaps this type of physics-level verification needs to be built into our phones and browsers, not just for text, but also images, video, and audio. would love to hear this community's thoughts on this topic.\nnote: this doesn't really prove that something wasn't written by AI. the idea is to raise the bar sufficiently to reduce the likelihood of something being AI written, and leave it to authors to decide how far they wish to go to prove to their audience that they did in fact write something themselves.\n- try it out: https://www.droptheslop.ai/ https://www.droptheslop.ai/ \n- demo: https://youtu.be/MEgo8xQNbdY?si=3cLc1xJ93XG_YDUj https://youtu.be/MEgo8xQNbdY?si=3cLc1xJ93XG_YDUj \n- verification for this post: https://www.droptheslop.ai/d/lMd7xoYx https://www.droptheslop.ai/d/lMd7xoYx",

I disagree - the way we interact with the internet is changing, and simply because a new technology carries risk doesn't mean that one cadre of society is uniquely well-equipped to understand and accept the risks.\nSo, I put my money where my mouth is and built LobsterHelper.\nEach instance runs in its own Firecracker micro-VM with LUKS-encrypted storage. Not Docker containers on shared infra. The VMs have no public IP - all access goes through an authenticated proxy.\nI can't make the AI safe yet, but I can make the infra safe, and that's a good place to start.\nWe've got a long dev-log lined up (3rd party api configuration on platform, token metering, free token use tiers, openclaw UI enhancements) and we'll have bonuses for early adopters along the way.\nWe're on a long journey to make these technologies safer and more accessible, and we'd hope you join us for the ride.\nAlex",

      "body_text": "Today I come to you on this beautiful Friday with a freshly hardthink-ed solution to a proliferous problem plaguing our world: the loss of original voice. The blanket of blandness slowly suffocating centuries of writing.\nOr to put it bluntly: AI writing is trash.\nIt is disrespectful to expect ME to read something YOU could not even be bothered to write (or likely even read).\nThe lingering human connection that remained resilient on the internet - through\nyears of SEO optimisation, propaganda bots, ads, regional firewalls, politics, censorship - is now being diluted even further.\nMany of the posts I eagerly click on HN (especially sorting by new) are now disappointingly, ragingly, completely AI generated.\nThis includes several that reach the front page on a daily basis. It's shameless.\nUnfortunately, many of you educated readers are oblivious to the tropes and tells or too eager to discuss the topic to notice.\nTo combat this (and because I'm petty) I (and ironically Claude) built a directory and several tools to name and shame these patterns. Both to educate those are not AI-literate and to spread awareness. NOT TO HARASS.\ntropes.fyi is a catalogue of the recurring tropes, tics, structures and word choices that give away AI-generated writing. Each trope is documented with a name, description, real-world examples and the category it falls under (word choice, sentence structure, tone, formatting, composition).\nThere are currently 32 tropes. Some highlights:\n- Negative Parallelism: \"It's not X — it's Y.\" The SINGLE MOST COMMON AI writing tell. One per piece is fine. Ten in a blog post is insulting. AND I HAVE SEEN TEN IN A BLOG POST.\n- Tricolon Abuse: The compulsive rule of three. \"Products impress people; platforms empower them. Products solve problems; platforms create worlds.\"\n- Em-Dash Addiction: A beautiful punctuation. Once the sign of a brilliant writer now too many of these is a red flag. I still use them, you won't break my spirit.\n- \"Delve\" and Friends: Perhaps the most infamous. \"Delve\" went from uncommon to appearing in a staggering percentage of AI text. See also: \"leverage\", \"robust\", \"harness\".\nfull directory: https://tropes.fyi/directory https://tropes.fyi/directory \nai;dr - Paste a link to any article. It will strip the AI fluff using our trope detection rules, then feed the skeleton to a lightweight llm which reverse-engineers it back to the prompt they likely* typed :D.\n3000 words of slop → 30-word prompt + whatever unique insights (if any) survived the bloat. try it: https://tropes.fyi/aidr https://tropes.fyi/aidr \nAI Vetter - Paste a URL, get a verdict. The AI Vetter fetches article content, runs rule-based pattern matching against all 32 tropes and returns a score on the scale: Human → AI-assisted → Suspicious → Barely Legible → Pure AI Slop. try it: https://tropes.fyi/vetter https://tropes.fyi/vetter \ntropes.md - A single file you can drop into any AI assistant's system prompt so it avoids these patterns.

      "body_text": "Hi HN, This started as a weekend brainfuck interpreter and kept growing. I got curious whether you could make a usable serverless platform out of languages that were never intended for this.\nOtherFunc is a serverless function platform for languages no major cloud provider (to my knowledge) supports. There are currently implementations of brainfuck, Forth, APL, Lisp (Scheme-like), and BASIC.\nThe interpreters are written in Rust, compiled to a single Wasm binary, and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. You can finally write Forth and publish it as an HTTP endpoint. You can see some examples on the showcase page: https://otherfunc.com/showcase https://otherfunc.com/showcase \n- brainfuck can make HTTP requests. The tape is extended to 33,000 cells with a memory-mapped I/O region. You write a URL to cells 30,000+, set a method byte, trigger execution, and the response appears in cells 31,000+. The Brainfuck program to do this runs ~35,000 characters, but it works.\n- The interpreters use a coroutine/yield pattern for I/O instead of async. When code needs to make an HTTP call or access KV storage, the interpreter suspends with an IoRequest, the Worker performs the fetch, then resumes execution with the response.\n- There's an MCP server so AI assistants can deploy functions directly. The thought was, if an LLM is writing all your code anyway, the language it is written in doesn't really matter. But you probably don't want to waste your tokens writing bf either.\nCode is available here: https://github.com/otherfunc https://github.com/otherfunc",

      "body_text": "A few months ago I opened my notes app to find something important. I couldn’t find it. Instead, I found dozens of half-finished thoughts, article highlights, screenshots from YouTube, research notes, business ideas I had at 2am, university notes, and “important concepts” I had promised myself I’d revisit. The worst part wasn’t that it was messy. The worst part was that I remembered writing all of it — I just didn’t remember what it actually said.\nThat’s when it hit me: we don’t have an information problem anymore. We have a retention problem. We save everything. Articles. PDFs. Tweets. Meeting notes. Video insights. Random ideas. But two weeks later, most of it is gone from our head. The insight decays. The context disappears. The connection between ideas fades. Our notes slowly turn into an archive instead of an asset.\nWhat frustrated me most was realizing I kept relearning the same things. I’d read about mental models, startup distribution, learning science, systems thinking — and every time it felt new. But it wasn’t new. I’d seen it before. I just didn’t retain it. That’s when I had an uncomfortable realization: my “second brain” wasn’t a brain at all. It was a storage locker. It stored information, but it didn’t help me remember or use it.\nMost tools are optimized for storing, organizing, tagging, formatting, linking. They assume you’ll come back and reread your notes. But you usually don’t. And even if you do, rereading isn’t the same as remembering. Real retention requires re-exposure, active recall, and spaced repetition — the same principles behind learning science — but applied to everyday thinking and work, not flashcards and exam prep.\nSo I started asking a different question. Instead of “How do I organize my notes better?” I asked, “How do I make sure I actually remember what I capture?” That shift changed everything. What if your notes didn’t just sit there? What if they occasionally asked you to explain an idea in your own words? What if they reminded you of a concept right before you forgot it? What if they connected new thoughts to old ones automatically and resurfaced insights you saw months ago when they became relevant again?\nThat’s the idea I started building around. I’m working on something called Neuron. The core loop is simple: Capture → Understand → Remember → Retrieve → Reuse. You throw everything in — notes, links, PDFs, highlights, voice ideas — and the system handles structure automatically. Behind the scenes it extracts key ideas, builds a living knowledge graph, generates contextual recall prompts, and schedules spaced repetition quietly in the background. You don’t “study.” You just spend a few minutes a day reinforcing what actually matters.\nThe goal isn’t to build another note-taking app. It’s to build something memory-first. Something that turns knowledge into something that compounds instead of decays. If this resonates - especially if you feel like you consume way more than you retain — I’d genuinely love you",

I figured perhaps I could learn some music theory more deeply by encoding the logic into software, as well.\nI came across this table < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)#Examples https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)#Examples > that breaks down the composition of chords logically. I was reminded of a bitmask, so I translated each chord into a 12–bit bitmask with a bit for each distinct note letter name (e.g. “C” or “B♭”). Decoding binary was involved in interfacing with MIDI … that might have been the inspiration — regardless, a bitmask seems ideal for this purpose.\nThe most challenging part by far was the logic that determines whether say, “A♯/B♭” (which are considered to be the same note in the 12–tone chromatic scale) should be rendered as “A♯” or “B♭”. As best as I understand, this depends on key signature context, and the logic regarding this isn’t well-described. I settled on finding the diatonic scale (7–note) that contains the maximum number of notes that the chord also contains. That diatonic scale provides the context for the note letter names. This logic isn’t perfect yet — the scales that include double flats and double sharps (which I wasn’t previously aware of) still provide ambiguous results.",
